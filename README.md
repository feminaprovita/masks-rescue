# masks-rescue

This project is full of data and scripts created by Brian Lagoda and Claire Gilligan
in order to save the contents of the Google Plus Communities for [Masks: A New Generation RPG](https://www.magpiegames.com/masks/),
and which they expanded to do the same for all and the other wonderful [Magpie Games](https://www.magpiegames.com) RPGs with active G+ communities.

This repo contains archived posts, comments, and metadata for Masks, [Bluebeard's Bride](https://www.magpiegames.com/bluebeards-bride/),
[Epyllion](https://www.magpiegames.com/epyllion/), [Urban Shadows](https://www.magpiegames.com/our-games/urban-shadows/), and [Velvet Glove](https://www.magpiegames.com/product/velvet-glove-notebook-edition-printpdf/).

The original scrape contains data from January 2013 through mid-February 2019, and
will be updated until Google cuts off Plus on April 1.

Note: This content, originally publicly posted to Google Plus, is not ours, but
belongs to the original posters and/or creators. We merely captured the data before
it was lost forever.
