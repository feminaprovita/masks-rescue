# masks-rescue

This project is full of data and scripts created by Brian Lagoda and Claire Gilligan
in order to save the contents of the Google Plus Community for [Masks: A New
Generation RPG](https://plus.google.com/communities/110704683035976001273).

The original scrape contains data from the launch of the Kickstarter in
September 2015 through mid-February 2019, and will be updated until Google cuts
off Plus in April.

(Real disclaimer to follow -- the contents are not ours! We're just preserving this data, which was publicly available, and belongs to the creators/original posters.)
