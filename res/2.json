(As a fair warning, I haven&#39;t read a teen magazine in decades, so it&#39;s possible I&#39;m super far off!)<br /><br />Capes (or maybe just Cape) is your fashion mag for and about supers. Most of what&#39;s in there is highlighting civilian outfits of known heroes, critiquing what new heroes are wearing, or tips on how to dress &quot;hero chic&quot;. Teen Capes is probably exactly what you&#39;d expect, but they&#39;d also occasionally have life-saving tips for those who want to become heroes themselves.<br /><br />Watchmen is more heavily focused on &quot;keeping the public informed&quot;. What this means in practice is a lot of rumors about what villains are secretly plotting, and how heroes are secretly plotting against you. Watchmen&#39;s a more conservative-leaning magazine than most - don&#39;t expect to get a fair shake, especially if you&#39;re not a straight, white cis man. It used to be a reputable source, decades ago, but it&#39;s fallen far.<br /><br />Finally, there&#39;s Bad Boys. Imagine the sort of adoration and devotion that gets lauded on Justin Beiber, One Direction, and those sorts of teen heartthrobs. Only instead of pop stars, it focuses on, well, &quot;bad boys&quot; - which ranges from delinquent young heroes to dangerous but popular supervillains. The heroes of your game may or may not feature in there - but it&#39;s safe to assume that the less they want to be in there, the more likely they will be (and vice versa)."

If they are adults then some age adjustment should be all that is necessary...<br /><br />Anyway here is one I came up with:<br /><br />Strategem - Team Leader - Abilities: Physical Perfection, Perfect Memory - Bio: Annabelle Ferris(16) Has trained her body to the limit of what a normal human is capable of since she was young, This combined with her incredible memory makes he one of the most formidable heroes to exist despite her age. In combat, she can perfectly mimic an opponent&#39;s fighting style after just seeing them do something once, so long as they are doing so with physical talent or a weapon. She is also excellent when it comes to situations that require problem-solving in hero work as she has memorized every case file she has access to and read every book of conventional strategy. <br />Weaknesses: Creative Thinking-Annabelle has come to rely on her memory as a crutch, and never bothered to learn actual problem-solving as her memory mimics this but even better,  if she encounters a situation where she has little to no prior context then she will hit a mental blank and be entirely unsure of what to do, <br /><br />Arrogance-Due to her commonly undisturbed record of success,  Anabelle cannot cope with failure, and will never admit if she isn&#39;t the smartest person, and will often even act as though she knows exactly what to do even if she is clueless. She never asks for help with ideas and takes even a suggestion that someone MIGHT know more than her as a personal attack."

He finds himself facing danger purely by chance, and wins the day through no fault of his own. It&#39;s terrifying to live through, but he knows it would be worse if he ever told anyone the truth. Because as everyone knows, if you point out your luck you immediately lose it, and if all he was left with was the downswing of his powers he wouldn&#39;t last a week.<br /><br /><b>LASERFACE</b> mainly became a cop for the health and dental, figuring it would be an easy gig in a city brimming with superheroes to do all the real work. But when she took advantage of the free health insurance to have her vision corrected, there was an accident that overloaded the surgical laser, bombarding her optic nerves with strange and exotic energies.<br /><br />Ever since then, she&#39;s been able to emit electromagnetic waves of any frequency from her eyes. With high intensity light, she can burn through steel. With x-rays, she can see through walls. With radio, she can jam comms. With microwave and infrared emissions, she can cook popcorn and change the channel without leaving the sofa. Mostly the team gets use out of the first three."

        "content": "I found the &quot;you are not killers&quot; rule in Masks very refreshing on account of all the grim grim dark grim that I otherwise imbibe on a daily basis. Players have had to come up with some creative solutions now and again, and give their characters some very humanizing characterization, because of the enforcement of this rule.<br /><br />In a fairly long running campaign, we&#39;ve had one killing. Our Protege used a Moment of Truth to take a handgun off of our not!Joker to shoot an unconscious not!Scarecrow, thereby preventing the doomsday machine that would&#39;ve amplified and projected his fear powers across the whole city from unleashing its apocalyptic wave of havoc.<br /><br />This changed everything. It made him feared by heroes and villains alike. It made his mentor, not!Batman, go on a crusade to see him imprisoned on murder charges and, failing that, turn the entire superhero community of Halcyon City against him. It ruined his life, changed his playbook, and set up a massive character growth arc involving the entire team that has yet to culminate. <br /><br />This was one death. It was a big deal! I know it&#39;s unrealistic, but treating human life with this kind of value and gravity has been really entertaining, and hella dramatic."

Ever. With the (usual) redemption / grow arc, that bring the machine-teen to understand the world, and gain human feelings. Great space for epic, struggling stories, in it."

Two that come to mind are Terminator 2 (&quot;They&#39;ll Live&quot;) and the recent Lost in Space TV series. I would totally RP those moments. But probably not in Masks with a PC.

Katya had always been fascinated with the Golden Age heroes and wanted to emulate them. It wasn&#39;t until she stumbled across the armor of the Golden Age hero known as the Grey Gallant that she found the means to fulfill her dream.<br /><br />-When did you first put on your costume?<br />After repairing the armor (Grey Gallant had met a grizzly end) and painting it a bright emerald green, Katya started walking a beat in search of injustice.<br /><br />-Who, outside the team, thinks you shouldn&#39;t be a superhero?<br />Her grandmother would rather she focus on her schoolwork or other, local, means of helping the community (instead of playing at being a knight and causing more harm than good).<br /><br />-Why do you try to be a hero?<br />For Katya, it&#39;s fun first and consequences later. She also is in love with the idea of being a close-to-home hero, someone who spends their time helping the community thrive, instead of always focusing on world ending threats. Much like the Golden Age heroes she emulates, she thinks small picture, not large.<br /><br />-Why do you care about the team?<br />&quot;Together, we are strong.&quot; It also helps that she mother hens the younger heroes. She is all heart.<br /><br />Drives:<br />-Lead the team successfully into battle.<br />-Help a teammate when they need you most.<br />-Save a teammate&#39;s life.<br />-Stop a fight with calm words.<br /><br />Katya as a hero is very much inspired by Overwatch&#39;s Reinhardt (but w/o the power armor and rocket hammer, natch) and my own love of my grandparents and the stories of their lives.<br />As a character, she is very much big hearted. A caring person who wants to help others as much as she can, mixed with a loud, boisterous personality.<br />Plus I liked the idea of a Modern hero who wasn&#39;t inspired by Bronze or Silver -agers.<br /><br />Hope you have fun! I sure am!",

His father, Diego, worked on a research project at Atomo Labs. The project involved dangerous isotopes that would hopefully be used to produce efficient nucleardriven engines. Unknown to Thomas’ father, these isotopes would cause his son to be a mutant, and cause his early death.   <br /><br />Diego died when Thomas was only 12 years old. Thomas could not handle his father’s death, and started to rebel. He took in with several street gangs as way to get out of the house. At the age of 14, Thomas’ mutant powers started to manifest themselves. At first, Thomas would wake up soaking wet. Soon, he noticed that his skin was becoming clear, and that he quickly became dehydrated. The other members of his gang turned against Thomas, and threw him out when they saw his skin changing. In a fit of rage, Thomas sent the gang leader 30 feet in the air with a jet of high-pressure water! Thomas had nowhere to turn, so he returned home.   <br /><br />Thomas’ mother, Maria, took in her son, and has gained back his respect and love. The two have made a pact that they will do anything in their power to make sure these strange mutant powers do not prevent Thomas from making a normal life for himself. Thomas is currently a model student at Halcyon High School, and plans to take the accelerated placement exam for Chemistry and Computer Science. <br />",

She was also, thanks to the impressive weapons suite on her Yacht, probably the single most destructive member of the party in a collateral sense, although our Legacy gave her a good run for the money.<br /><br />If I had the time to do this game over again, I&#39;d have emphasized her grease-monkey love affair with primitive Earth-tech a lot more than I was able to.  This is an Imperial Princess who would rather be down in the motor pool with a spanner and some lug nuts.<br /><br />",
