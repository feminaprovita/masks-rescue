    "content": "A huge moment for our Doomed this session. She'd discovered a costly way to push back her Doom, at the cost of a number of her memories. Here's the custom move I wrote that literally brought players to tears:<br /><br />When you <b>wear the crown of glass thorns</b> to purge yourself of memories roll +Doom Track markings.<br /><br />No matter what, every player present will propose memories that you have lost. You and the GM can both add to or edit these slightly. Mark an appropriate Condition.<br /><br />On a 10+, clear a Doomsign and choose two. On a 7-9, clear your Doom Track and choose three.<br />—One of your secrets comes spilling out of you in the process. Now others know it but you do not.<br />—Shift a pair of locked labels. Explain how your self-image has changed permanently.<br />—Lose Influence over someone important to you as you forget everything about them.<br />—Whoever helped you put on the crown also loses an important memory and marks a Condition.<br /><br />On a miss, mark potential and clear two marks from your Doom Track, but your memory loss is severe. What basic move can you no longer use?<br />",

Panic (The Doomed) takes command of some Rime Court hunters, and then freezes time for a heart-to-heart with Halfpenny about ethics. (She also flirts with him a little, to no avail.)<br /><br />Sonia (The Soldier) defies Sir Quest when he uses her &quot;Ignition&quot; dogtags against her (revealing her new code name, “Caldera”). They free Baron Devastation, but find they cannot leave the room with the Rime Throne empty. Panic’s Doom looms as the empty throne beckons...<br /><br />But Torq (The Nova) uses a moment of truth to forestall this, smashing out of the throne room and wrecking the Rime Palace in the process. On to Darkhavia!<br /><br />Sonia/Caldera helps Devastation retake the country and spark wannabe Forgeling Beachead into Obsidious. But she also sees how her absence left all her Forge allies in jeopardy—Furnace captured, Aislin in the wind, Dr. Nix in F.A.T.E custody...<br /><br />So, Sonia/&quot;Ignition&quot;/Caldera retires from the Salvatores to take a leadership position with the Forge, hoping to help the organization she once ran from become better. Rattled, the rest of the team prepare to return to Capstone, as they hear disturbing news about its state...<br /><br />To be continued in March! What has become of Capstone?
