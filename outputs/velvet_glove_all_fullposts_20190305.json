Please let us know if that option seems of interest to you!<br /><br />Let the polling commence! And, of course, more detailed feedback in the comments is always welcome :)<br />",

Currently none of the <i>Velvet</i> <i>Glove</i> playbooks have one, so don't worry about that for now. Other PbtA games do have them, however.<br /><br />There are a few things you can do to figure out where to go next. During the first session, you would have named a few other gangs in the area, as well as a dangerous part of the city. Push the girls towards it, or set up a situation where they have to interact with that other gang. <br /><br />Ask the players what kind of crime they normally do, then give them opportunities to do it. Something will probably go wrong, and then things will get interesting.<br /><br />You can start them out in school each session as well. Drop them in a boring class with a lecherous teacher and watch things go bad. <br /><br />And always ask the players what they do after you make a GM move. That should help move the fiction forward.<br /><br />Hope that helps! Feel free to ask more questions here, or check out some of the other PbtA communities for more info."

I saw that the book recommends doing a &quot;start of session&quot; move but was a little confused about what those could be. <br /><br />Again, sorry about the questions that were probably answered elsewhere. I'm just trying to figure out how I could be a little more prepared for the next time I play.

Do you have any suggestions for addressing this or agree to soften it in advance? It seems to me you want to have a genuine experience but would have to make it clear to the players that views held by the npcs are not your own!! PS you mention articles and stories dealing with race in the 70s do you have any recommendations? ",
