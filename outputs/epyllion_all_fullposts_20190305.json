Before we get sucked into the black hole that can be the holiday season, we would like to gather some intel on where and how our fans would like to transition this community.<br /><br />Some of you may already use Discord or Reddit, but we know some people find those spaces difficult to navigate. That said, some people want to avoid using Facebook for gaming conversations. While there might not be a perfect space, we’d love a medium in which everyone feels comfortable free to engage, and able to easily reach out to us with questions about gameplay, mechanics, etc.<br /><br />In addition to options like Discord or Facebook, we’re also considering opening up our own Magpie forums on <a href=\"http://magpiegames.com\" >magpiegames.com</a> as we revamp the site over the next couple of months. Please let us know if that option seems of interest to you!<br /><br />Let the polling commence! And, of course, more detailed feedback in the comments is always welcome :)<br />",

Which other dragon was angered by this broken tradition ?<br /><br />This way, you link the fiction with your change. Playing to see what happens might enlighten you about why"

        "content": "One of my favorite ways of making Dragonia Feel dragon is his to play up the size differences, Dragonschange a lot with age. Since the players are usually very young dragons, everything is big to them. Describe them going up flights of stairs where each step is nearly as tall as they are. Big cities, where ancient dragons do important political work, are built to truest massive scale. Here, a stairway might have smaller flights built into it's edges so that smaller drakes can ascend them.<br /><br />There's also other details, what they eat, their furniture, that changes for dragon physiology. I usually describe them curling up in luxurious nests rather than sitting at desks. They might smoke sugar sand that stains their lips and claws pink.<br /><br />In many ways it's similar to making any other fantasy world, you just want to make it over-the-top fantastic. The media I get inspired by isn't generally about dragons. Zootopia and My Little Pony are both good sources."

Aside from the different reasons that make the game a good choice to play with kids, I chose to try Epyllion with them because of the Friendship Gems, and the hope that it could help them taking good habits of friendly relations (instead of fighting and arguing and dirtytricksing all day long...).<br /><br />They seem to have no problem picturing themselves as dragons, they have fleshed out their dragonselfs very well and always have a lot of amazing ideas each time I ask for things to build on. Most of the time I have to hit the brake after a few sentences so that we stay somewhat on track. I am amazed at how quickly they appropriated the idea of &quot;mixed beasts&quot; and how many wonderful creatures they have created :)<br /><br />Right now, it is mostly working well, with a few sessions under our belt. I just try to prepare the description of a few dragons or beasts between each sessions and all the rest is taking shape dynamically. <br /><br />Still, I feel a little uneasy as far a describing dragons, the houses of dragons, the cities of dragons, the lands and other inhabitants of Dragonia, and so forth. I am not quite used to describing a world without any humanoid bipeds in the primary roles. I feel like I use up ideas too quickly. <br /><br />I think the main thing is that, in order for dragons to craft objects, or read books, they need to be a little more anthropomorphous than what is described in most fantasy literature (at least from what I have read). Like, they need to be able to sit, carry bags, put elbows on a desk in order to write, etc... <br /><br />I have started looking for some fantasy literature showing the world from a dragon's point of vue. My first, easy find was the dragon series from E.E Knight, which gives me a lot of ideas. But still, the dragons that are depicted can't do a lot of things with their clawed paws. AuRon seems to be able to read humanoid books, but beside that he isn't able to do much more than any quadruped. <br /><br />I also found the adventures of Sir Benfro, written by J. D. Oswald. He describes a village of dragons, with houses and tables and everything. They seem to be able to do a lot of things, but the way they are depicted, they might as well be humanoids. There is nothing in the text that explicitly explains how they do all these things. If you jump to a random chapter narrated by Benfro, you couldn't tell he is a dragon from the way his actions are depicted. He might as well be a human. Disappointing.<br /><br />I would be glad to see any sharing of ideas and source of ideas about how would be a world of dragons like Dragonia :)<br />",

My other concern is that I won't be able to come up with something on the fly (hazards, NPC goals/desires, solutions to problems) or come up with a satisfactory wrap up when the session is up. <br /><br />Would it be better for me to come up with 3-4 hazards/plot hooks, a bunch of NPCs with problems, desires and goals and then just pick from that list based on how the session is running? For example, if I get a group that is really interested in exploring the traditions of Dragonia, I'd pick a hazard that remains in the city, or if theya re more interested in an adventure, I'd pick a hazard that has to do with exploring the wilderness.<br /><br />Thoughts?<br /><br />",

        "content": "My experience has been that worldbuilding in Epyllion is straight forward, especially compared to more traditional games, because player input is expected and encouraged. Creating the map as a group of players is really powerful both to build investment and give you ideas to play off of. Remember that players get to answer questions when you ask, but you (usually) get to choose those questions.<br /><br />Epyllion's text is pretty open about what goes on the map - I'm a big fan of asking players to tell me about a House Stronghold their dragons grew up in. This makes players think about a lot of things - The flavors of their House, the age hierarchy of dragons (Who bossed you around? Which older dragon did you befriend?) and go crazy and create the fantastic places in Dragonia (Crystal domes under the water, volcano forges, wild sand gardens etc)<br /><br />I also think getting really familiar with the (slightly different)nature of Epyllion's moves helps. Moves <i>move</i> the fiction forward pass or fail, keep those lists handy, think of examples so you're not totally flat footed when people present a golden opportunity or roll miss on that crucial roll. <br /><br />Lastly, I'd say don't be stingy about reminding people to give gems (putting Virtues on name tents helps) or handing out shadow points. Everyone loves and fears being their shadowself once in awhile."

I think unlearning many years of D&amp;D and World of Darkness games will be extremely fun to achieve,<br /><br />Marissa, thanks a lot for that idea. I am all for learning Epyllion and its internal logic, but I am sure that since my friends are all used to the kind of threat for a life/death in combat situation, your suggestion is perfect and makes a lot of sense. I love it and I really appreciate the help.<br /><br />I will let you all how it goes."

I have looked in the book about rules for damage and dying.<br />I noticed that damage makes the player check the shadow track and once all 4 are marked, then the drake turns into dris shadowself.<br /><br />I will start playing this game with a group of mature players, and definitively, death of the character can be the worst thing that can happen it can also be extremely interesting to see how it turns out in the fiction, especially if the character is returned through moon magic.<br /><br />In any case, I have been looking into the rules and I didn't find anything about dying or damage outside of the shadow track. Can you guys point me in the right direction for these rules?<br /><br />This is my first time with an Apocalypse World rules game, so I am not sure if I am missing the point on something.<br /><br />Thanks.",

Dada is similarly easy.<br /><br />So, assuming you don't want to just use mommy and daddy, think about what sounds are easy for dragons to make and craft your equivalents from there.<br /><br />Mind you, I don't know what sounds are easy for dragons to make. Do they hiss? Do they use their teeth more than their lips?"

Somehow, I felt a dragon's game had to have a hand-made map. That's one aspect I loved from being a GM, and it's been a while since I had to draw a map for the world of a game. <br /><br />Just my own personal experience, of course. I have seen digital maps that are extremely nice and perfect as handouts to players."

Another friend still needs some more time with the rules, I think. When we play other games, he is always trying to maximazing character bonuses, I guess it's his way to feel that he is beating the game. He is very rules oriented. It's going to be interesting to see how he manages this game, thnat has less authority on the DM and also, when he sees the newest players really rolling with their dragons.<br />In the end, everyone was very exceited and everyone was looking for pictures of dragons on the internet to get their ideas. Funny thing is that the Daredevil and the Champion of the group they both decided on the same kind of connection without saying anything, that was so nice to have their stories coinnect without them speaking before hand.<br />Oh, I forgot to say that half the group hadn't met the other half before the creation of characters, so it is also exciting to see how they will play over time.<br />Sadly, I will be out on travels for a few weeks, so we might have to wait until october to play the game. I will keep you posted."

People reacted as I expected, so used to my games being dark and full of dangers, which is not the approach I decided for Epyllion.<br /><br />One of the players is an experienced player, but he has never played with any of my other players, and he is the crafter of the team. I think he had the hardest time adapting to the nature of Epyllion. <br /><br />But the daredevil and the warrior were having a blast. The daredevil is an orange dragon with its back scales and horns color blue, and an iridescent color when dre opens dre wings. She was pushing everyone to glide from the mountain top city where they live to go to where the adventure was taking them.<br /><br />The warrior is playing her character as a strong dragon who feels the need to grow fast and demonstrate dre can have a positive impact in dre society. Dre is a onyx + red huge dragon.<br /><br />Funny thing, these 2 players met for the first time when making the characters and now they have become like the spirit of the group.<br /><br />One aspect that I have truly enjoyed and that I was not expecting is that the players have decided to play the characters as truly young and naive. They are playing characters that at the same time are eager to prove themselves, but who also don't want to grow up and stop being young. I think there is a lot of potential for the game there.<br /><br />There is also a shy player who is playing the academic in the group. A small black dragon that has some red lava veins,and wears glasses. It is the voice of reason for the daredevil and warrior and that is so much fun. I this these 3 will pull the other players in unexpected directions.<br /><br />I decided to play &quot;The Names of the Dark&quot; that Marissa shared here. We didn't advance that much, but the character just had a nice dinner with Thilda and Chelle and have talked about the legends of the War with the Darkness.<br /><br />I love the simplicity of the rules. The players seem to love them as well. Everything moves so fast and yes, they earned quite a few XP due to failures when trying to glide to Castle Greysky, but I think the players are really excited. <br /><br />I really love this game, this is definitively the sleeper hit for me in terms of the games I have tried."

I know the little ones will care a lot about their Gems; before starting, I know that it will be difficult for them to accept Returning X Gems then roll and see that they still get a 6-, or that they could have had a 10+ without Returning any Gem. <br /><br />So I am considering telling them that they can choose to Return Gems after they make the roll, in order to buy a better result (instead of betting for one...). <br /><br />I would be like to know others' thoughts on this, if in your experience of the game you have had this question come up from your players ? <br />"

Great stuff, but there's a couple things I'm unclear on and wondering about:<br />On page 88, one of the wilderness moves is &quot;Take away one of the clutch's Things&quot;, with Things capitalized and italicized. Is this a game term that I missed somewhere, or just a cute way of emphasizing the value that dragons place on their possessions?<br /><br />When using moon magic, is it required that at least one gem is returned? Or is it just a rather good idea, given the potentially wild consequences of a miss?<br /><br />Relatedly, is it intended that a dragon in Shadowself can use shadow magic at +4 as much as dre wants? (Presumably, this is mitigated by the potentially hefty consequences of a miss or even a 7-9.)<br /><br />From the examples, it seems like marking Shadows is a relatively common outcome, but unless I missed something, dragons only get to potentially remove one Shadow per session; is it intended that passing into and recovering from Shadowself is the primary way of clearing Shadows?<br /><br />How does the principle of &quot;only trigger moves when the outcome is in doubt&quot; interact with magic in the setting? Is using magic always a big and risky thing, or can a dragon do &quot;routine&quot; magic like creating a light to illuminate a dark cave? (And if so, is this a common ability in the setting or an extraordinary one?) Can a dragon have magical abilities that aren't tied to the moons or to Darkness? (The examples of play involving rituals would seem to imply this.)",

Our young drakes went on a mission to retrieve a pearl so that a dragon could propose to a clutchmate. They stole some potions from a sleeping dragon, and they faced off against the Moltis (Mole-Mantis) queen with wit and nerve, and got caught by a Pillear (A Pill bug-Bear), and cast some powerful magics to calm the angry hearts and control the wind, and they broke up a fight between the long tooth drakes that broke out over fighting about the pearl. The proposal may not have gone well, but the young drakes were successful in creating peace where there was nothing but anger and confusion.<br /><br />Good job to my players.",

The game should last no more than four hours. I'll have some pre-generated dragons ready, or you can bring your own. I'm planning to use Google Hangouts, but I can adapt if people would rather use Roll20 or Skype or some other platform.<br /><br />This is an early test of an adventure I plan to run at Origins, and I'm hoping to find out what happens when I put it out in front of actual players.<br /><br />Reply if you're interested and I'll set up a private G+ group to discuss scheduling and characters.",

We're unlikely to have a final version for some time (until all the art is done), so they thought that was the best move.<br /><br />Unlike Masks, Epyllion is very, very close to being completely finished. Rather than release a draft that's close but not final, we're holding that back until we're ready to release a print-ready proof. Final layout changes are being made now to both the deck and the book, so we expect all that to be ready quite soon (days/weeks!)<br /><br />We really appreciate you waiting so long for the book. We know it's been longer than expected, and no one wants to see this book in backers' hands more than Marissa and the Epyllion team. We're almost there!"

The pregenerated dragon characters I gave out included the Academic, the Daredevil, the Seer, and the Warrior. I excluded the Crafter and the Nature Adepts since I didn't think they'd have much to do in this scenario. I leveled up the characters to Winged Drakes to give them a little more breadth of ability, and because I wanted them to be able to fly all the way up to the summits of the Longtail Mountains on their own.<br /><br />It's a short adventure. I got through it in two hours pretty consistently. If you have more time, you can certainly let your players linger around some of the setting elements and try to resolve some of the other questions in the adventure outside the main mission. Do Thilda and Chelle ever make it to the capital? Does Krim recover his courage? Does Aeria ever break out of the prison of resentment that her ancestors built for her? Will the PCs ever get any more of that cake?",

I'm hoping to run Epyllion at Games on Demand at GenCon, and I have a couple of questions about the playbooks and basic moves:<br /><br />Most of the basic moves don't list the effects of a miss. Should we assume that, on a miss, something bad happens and the DM and players work it out in context?<br /><br />Also, the DM's moves sheet suggests that the DM can &quot;inflict wounds (as established)&quot; and &quot;trade wounds (as established)&quot;. When would a dragon receive a wound? Should the DM just assign wounds as penalties for missed moves?",

The rules are easy to grasp even when I haven't explained them very well. My third session included a player who had never roleplayed before, and she jumped right in and was storytelling along with the rest of the clutch.<br /><br />I did notice that it seemed trivially easy for players to hand around friendship gems. Since these were just 2-hour sessions, I wasn't too worried, since it helped the players build up to the big rolls they needed near the end. However, players who weren't casting magic were able to save up quite a big bonus for &quot;help another dragon&quot; rolls. Over time I expect it would take some of the drama out of things if you were sitting on 10 gems and you could always roll a hit on your &quot;help another&quot; rolls. Possibly I've misread part of the rules there.<br /><br />Overall, though, this was a joy to run, and I'm looking forward to trying it again at the next Games on Demand. I'm also planning to clean up my GM notes for the adventure and share them with the G+ group.",

I don't know how much this stuff is still in flux, but this one feels weird and off to me. I'd expect the daredevil to have, I dunno, awesome flying maneuvers or something as a signature move.",

I was mostly wanting it to be something that could happen frequently, since every use is a practice of the real life skill of affirmation that I am hoping for. Therefore, I also wanted it to be a move that's available even when you have 0 gems from another person. Would it be better if only the &quot;erase shadow&quot; options come with the cost of 1 gem? &quot;Erase a shadow and return a gem&quot;<br /><br />I originally had all 4 options like you suggest with 10+=Choose 2 and 7-9=Choose 1. I changed it because I wanted the move to be primarily focused on serving others with personal benefits only as an unexpected or secondary bonus. I thought that the possibility of choosing only self-serving outcomes in place of others-serving ones seemed against the selfless spirit of what I hoped to encourage (which is the actual effort of practicing affirmation). Maybe I'm being a bit idealistic in that hope. :) I just want to avoid someone saying, &quot;Ok I say 'Hey buddy, you were so generous with that bully back there and I love that about you. I hope I can be as powerfully generous as you some day.' How nice of me. Ok I take +1 forward and erase a Shadow.&quot;"

This doesn't give you a completely selfless or selfish option, but it strikes a balance and prevents it from being one-sided. There's another option, but I'm trying to puzzle out the wording. This is too complex IMO, but something like:<br /><br />On 10+ or 7-9, choose one:<br />- your friend erases one shadow<br />- your friend takes +1 forward<br /><br />On 10+ you also choose one of the following (different from above):<br />- your friend erases one shadow<br />- your friend takes +1 forward<br />- you erase one shadow<br />- you take +1 forward<br /><br />There's also already a move to help a friend, which gives +1 to the result. Essentially with no gem cost, this becomes a preemptive help a friend, with lower risk (you aren't exposed to the danger on a 7-9 and get extra benefits on 10+)."

        "content": "I've edited the version in the main post of this thread with a distillation of some of these ideas. I hope it's not overly-complicated now.<br /><br />I like the gem cost for erasing shadow, since, fictionally, sometimes helping someone back to their truest self through some vulnerable sincerity can be stressful for the helper and perhaps messy or taxing for the relationship overall. I really appreciate the suggestions of alternatives. I'm always curious what rationale causes others to lean more one direction or another in design considerations, whether it's to balance other means of moderating shadow or gaining +1, or aiming for incentivizing different player behavior or attitudes in play.<br /><br />In fact, thank you for bringing up the similarity and difference from the basic Help/Hinder move. I had overlooked how similar they were, and not directly overlapping another move (especially a basic move) is important. Since my main goal with the move is to encourage players to actually practice watching for and seizing opportunities to sincerely affirm others, I don't mind that this move offers more reward with less cost. It could be argued that the Help/Hinder enjoys the bonus value of applying <i>after</i> another has rolled a move, along with the valuable flexibility of either helping or more potently hindering. I like that Affirming is a &quot;safer&quot; and pre-emptive route to mechanical bonuses, since then hopefully all players will get into a state of watching for opportunities to affirm, separate from just opportunities to share gems.<br /><br />On a more narrative note, helping/hindering doesn't necessarily determine anything new about two dragons' relationship (while most clutch mates might be expected to help each other, of course hindering someone often reveals new wrinkles or drama in a relationship). Meanwhile affirming another for a specific reason necessarily focuses on the emotional and identity-defining aspects of a relationship, specifically admiration and thoughtfulness. Plus I'd like to think taking +1 forward may result in a greater fictional tone of ongoing levity and intimacy than the Help move since the bonus may stick around for a while before it's used, while helping/hindering applies only momentarily to whatever was just rolled. I'd like to think that +1 noted somewhere is like a warm-fuzzy afterglow that influences a dragon's actions and attitudes whenever they remember the source of it.<br /><br />Once again, thanks for your feedback from actual play experience and alternative suggestions!"

Does rolling a miss grant XP, or only end of session questions?<br /> 2. Do friendship gems carry over between sessions or reset? I would guess the former, but I'm not sure.<br /> 3. Does the first box of the XP track (the one that says &quot;XP:&quot;) also count as one to tick off? (meaning Raw Scaled Drakes need 6 xp to fill their track, not just 5)<br /> 4. When Flying through the Valley of Death, rolling +Gems probably refers to gems you have total, since there's no other person whose gems would count, and the move is more about the moons' overall stance toward you, right?<br /> 5. Is there anything official or public yet about how to run the <b>collaborative map-filling activity</b> at the start of a campaign that is shown in the YouTube Exhibition game? Does the GM just ask each player to tell about a bit of Dragonia history that their dragon was involved in and have them add a related location to the map?<br /> 6. Just to clarify, the default assumption is that dragons are the only sentient beings in Dragonia? The social moves all refer to dragons, and therefore don't technically seem extensible to something like intelligent nature faeries or spirits.<br /> — I'd love to hear any ideas or examples of how others have conveyed Darkness other than tangible predatory beasts or moral corruption among dragons.",

        "content": "Let's see... what are the mechanically vital parts of Epy, and how well would they translate to AT?<br /><br />1) Age/growing up. I feel like Adventure Time is actually more about <i>not</i> growing up (see: Jake vs. his kids, Ice King's back story and behavior), so you'd need to change up advancement and the age dependent moves. I could see the former changing to growing in heroism, like when Finn gets a new sword or reads from the Enchiridion. The latter could be more about power than age? Like, you can't really command a princess or a huge monster to do something, but you might impress or amuse them.<br /><br />2) Virtues/friendship. This would work fine. You don't really see stand out values like you do with, say, My Little Pony, but Finn and Jake do better when they work together and respect each other.<br /><br />3) Houses/family. These easily become Kingdoms.<br /><br />4) Moon magic. This is a tricky one. In Epy, magic is widespread and flexible, and having that flexibility narrowed (and growing in power so you don't need to rely on your friends D: ) is a big part of advancement/aging. In Adventure Time, though... well, you don't see many big and flashy mages, the ones you do see are often antagonists, and even their magic is usually tightly themed (Ice King, Flame Princess, Magic Man and his jerk curses). But everyone is a little bit wacky. Very rough idea: you have a 'magic' stat that grows as it does in base Epy, but instead of being tied to the moons it's tied to a single loosely-defined theme, like ice or fire or shapeshifting or science (I include the last for the Bubblegum types, though invention might be more of a playbook feature).<br /><br />5) The Darkness, and the battling thereof. The Lich is there in the background. Whether you count all monsters and dungeons as being part of the Darkness is another question entirely. I think shadow points can work as is; everyone in AT has their jerk moments.<br /><br />So, yeah! You'd have a couple of issues to tackle, but most of the skeleton fits very well I think."

I also like the cultural element of stories and artistic styles woven into these structures and the inter-generational dependency and opportunities for honor during the migrations. There are so many ideas for events and conflicts for a clutch in play from this description, I love it!<br /><br />Are saplings in such nest structures somehow sustained alive, maybe through magic, or do they just serve the same way as birds use twigs, they just happen to be huge twigs. Thanks +Jonathan Perrine, I look forward to more like this."

    "content": "I talk a lot about Strongholds in my game - Places where Dragons grow up. Here's one from one of my earliest games. After I post a few, I might write a move for the one that people seem to like most. <br /><br />Wickerhome (A Stronghold of HouseTessith)<br /><br />\tMany dragons of Tessith made promises to themselves and their families as they emerged from The War. The ancestors of Wickerhome’s inhabitants promised ‘Never Again’. Never again would they be tied to one place which could be besieged, and forced to choose between their lives and their homes. Under the leadership of elder crafters, and the hands of drake and dragon trained nearly from birth in the arts of weaving, Wickerhome wove itself shelter - Shelter that would never be tied to one strip of land. <br /><br />\tThe treehouse homes of this Tessith enclave resemble massive upside-down teardrops, woven from not reeds or grass but from massive strips of bark and whole saplings, with larger homes housing larger dragons, who seem to barely fit, bird-like, into the round holes of the homes. However, what makes Wickerhome’s dwellings unique is their mobility.<br /><br />Scouts map out copses of Leviathan Pines ahead of each migration. When the time comes for the nomadic tribe to move on, larger dragons merely unhook the dwellings of their smaller brethren from the branches and carry them to their new homes, hanging them in the boughs of a new, distant Leviathan. Of course, no larger dragons exist to carry the largest dwellings - Most seasons, the tribe’s largest members are content with the canopies for shelter, although a particularly beloved elder may receive a gigantic nest and ‘Honor Flight’ to move these enormous structures. <br /><br />Drakes are put to work young in the house. A young dragon might be tasked with scouring the forest floor for suitable materials, clambering over dwellings to spot weakness and perform repairs, and of course, every drake in Wickerhome is taught the ins and outs of elaborate weaving, both structural and decorative. In addition to woven art, Wickerhome's oral traditions are alive with stories woven through with clever and determined dragons, who always know when it is prudent to press onward valiantly, and when to withdraw and gather their friends. <br /><br />(Next- Rabaton, the Rothscar Supply Depot)",

    "content": "<b>Dreamation Epyllion LongCon Recap</b><br />The Magpie Games crew -- +Marissa Kelly, +Mark Diaz Truman, +Brendan Conway -- finished an Epyllion LongCon at Dreamation last weekend! It was an epic tale of friendship, shenanigans, dark dragons, political intrigue, wars against the darkness, and heroism!<br />We had around 13 or 14 players for each of our three sessions, with some people there for the whole ride, and some people moving in and out. Our players included: +Rich Flynn, +Matt Weber, +Graham W, +Jenn Martin, +Adrian Stein, +Eric Mersmann, +Zach Battleman, Lilith White, Jim Cummings, and many more! <br /> <br /><b>Session 1</b><br />In our first session, we:<br />- Introduced Dragonia<br />- Set our mandates<br />- Created our raw-scale drakes at each table<br />- Had each player add something to the map. <br /><br />This led to a Dragonia filled with strange and interesting places, like a massive chasm filled with shadow, an island from which all dragons were forbidden from flying, and a draconic boneyard in the capital city. <br /><br />We also had every player get together with other members of their draconic house, and then each house added something to a map. The drakes got to know their brethren from their own houses, and they added something to the setting that bound them together. Myndoth, for instance, added a massive library to the north of the island, while Kebros added a secret enclave of Kebros dragons who still had a connection to the darkness. <br /><br />It was awesome! It fleshed out Dragonia and made it the players' own. We need to consider how better to bring those elements in, so they crop up more during the actual play in future LongCons, but as a way of getting us into Dragonia and making it distinctive, it worked like a charm.<br /><br />Then we got to playing! Each table was its own clutch to start, sent on a mission by an elder dragon. Barge (played by Mark) sent his clutch out to investigate the Moonbeam Festival and its problems. Thornsnout (played by Marissa) sent out her clutch into the wilds of the great forest, where animals had been gathering in enormous quantities for reasons unknown, causing problems for the forest and its denizens. And Tass the Gigantic (played by Brendan) sent out a clutch into the Capital City itself, to find a restricted book stolen from the library, all about something dark and dangerous.<br /><br />Each clutch went after its problems in its own way. The clutch sent into the Moonbeam Festival discovered that location of the festival was actually once the site of a major battleground with a dark dragon, a champion of the shadow from the First War – Valketh. In a moment of foolishness, or perhaps bravery, <b>the young dragons of that clutch actually brought Valketh back to life!</b> She was not corrupted in her resurrected state, but that did not mean she was noble and innocent. She was still tinged by the sadness and pain that had driven her to the darkness in the first place, and the young dragons hid her away to keep her from being caught and persecuted by older dragons who might not trust her return – such as Barge, whom they were quickly discovering had a deeper history with Valketh.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the clutch sent into the forest discovered (after contending with the enormous beasts of the forest) that the wildlife therein were being called to the forest due to the return of the Great Spirit! <b>This was a great and momentous occasion, something heralding the rebirth of the forest into full life and vitality.</b> The young dragons guided that rebirth by restoring the Heart of the forest to the great tree at its center, and in so doing, they helped to resolve the troubles it had been facing – or so they thought…<br /> <br />And finally, the clutch sent into the city found that the stolen book was actually a biography of Valketh herself, detailing the &quot;apocryphal&quot; story of how she had once been a noble champion of Dragonia before a tragedy drove her to the darkness. After sneaking into the library and finding a magical escape route from the restricted section, they were forced to confront the librarian who stole the book, claiming that it was for a greater purpose, that it was for the good of Dragonia…*that she and those working with her could wield the darkness to fix Dragonia.* They left her behind, to go and report on their findings to Tass, while wary of larger conspiracies at work…<br /><br /><b>Session 2</b><br />This session opened up a bit differently. We had some new players, whom we helped quickly to create their dragons, and then got into a large LARP style scene, with all the young dragons come together in the dragon Council Hall, where Barge, Thornsnout, and Tass heard reports from them on their myriad missions. The dragons brought to the large meeting tales of their own doings, along with a fair amount of skepticism and concern over the goals, intentions, and desires of the larger dragons. During the meeting, it became clear that Barge had significant worries about the Darkness and its workings around Dragonia, and that Tass found such worries to be unfounded and overstating the problem, to the detriment of Dragonia. Thornsnout wanted to ensure that problems were dealt with appropriately, without Barge's fear-mongering or Tass's blindness. With the three elder dragons not in agreement, the young dragons were left to come to their own full conclusions about the next steps to take.<br /><br />Regardless of which mission the drakes undertook, all felt the power and the fear of the Darkness when <b>a lunar eclipse, unpredicted and surprising, came and cut off the connection to the moons throughout Dragonia.</b> It was an ill omen that predicted the tragic occurrences of their expeditions.<br /><br />One clutch of drakes set out to speak to Valketh where they had hidden her previously. Unfortunately, they found that she had escaped, and was now under threat of taking upon herself the same darkness that had made her such an opponent of Dragonia during the first war. The pain she felt came from a mission Barge had sent her clutch on. They had all perished doing Barge's work, and the pain of the tragedy, coupled with the Darkness's promise to reunite her with her clutch, drove her into shadow. Despite the efforts of the young dragons to talk her away from her dark path, she could not be swayed, and took the shadow back into herself as the moons were eclipsed. She gave them an opportunity to run before she could hurt them too much, her last act of goodness under the darkening moons. Even so, in the ensuing conflict, <b>one of their number faced the Silver Serpent of Death, who warned the young drake that Tass the Gigantic was a traitor!</b> In the struggle, they also stole the dark crown before Valketh could take it upon herself. Without it, she could not assume the full mantle of terrible power that would let her crush all those who opposed her. They left her as she was raising an ancient, fallen Tessith tower in the massive chasm of darkness, creating her new citadel.<br /><br />Another clutch of drakes went back into the forest, from which rumors of darkness beneath the roots of the Great Sage Tree continued to flow, despite the rebirth of the Great Spirit. There, they found a plot by dark dragons to corrupt the Great Spirit into the Darkbeast through a ritual performed under the great tree. <b>The Darkbeast, if unleashed, would rampage over all of Dragonia.</b> What's more, the lunar eclipse would be prolonged indefinitely so long as the Darkbeast existed. The young dragons acted decisively and bravely, though it cost them dearly – to stop the ritual, they were forced to kill the great tree at the center of the forest, ensuring that though it would survive, it would no longer be fully alive in the same way…at least, not for ages and ages to come. The Darkbeast's rising was prevented, by the heroic sacrifice of a young Crafter, but a silence spread throughout the forest.<br /><br />The third clutch went into the city to actually find the biography of Valketh stolen by the librarian. They found her hiding in the draconic boneyard, and they discovered where she had hidden the book. Upon reading it, they learned of Valketh's tragic past and her history with Barge, in addition to finding out that pages had been torn from the book – the pages detailing Valketh's good deeds, her nobility. They confronted the librarian about her misguided aims and goals, how she sought to control the Darkness when it would only control her, and discovered that she had been working with Tass, the council member, and that he had betrayed her! What's more, they discovered a new way to fight the Darkness growing in Dragonia as the lunar eclipse spread above them. <b>They could travel back in time and bring forward the young, brave, noble Valketh, a Valketh who might be able to stand against her terrible, older self.</b> And so they did, using the magic of the Darkness to travel back to a day long ago and convince young Valketh to come back with them, to when Dragonia needed her.<br /><br />At the end of the session, the dragons came together again, in the Council Hall, only to find that Barge had been censured and removed from the council, due to a vote instigated by Tass! Thornsnout was not happy with this turn of events, but Tass promised again and again that it was for the good of Dragonia, that Barge had simply grown too old and infirm, too paranoid, to serve on the Council. When the young drake who had fallen and seen the Silver Serpent stepped forward and accused Tass of being traitor, saying &quot;I have been charged with bringing you down!&quot;, it led to chaos. The young drake's clutchmates defended him, even as Tass called for guards to have the young drake removed, and ultimately ended the proceedings before the drakes could further air their grievances.<br /><br />The clutches met later, outside the council chamber, and revealed what they had learned and accomplished to each other. As a group, they decided they needed to speak to Barge, to find out what to do next.<br /><br /><b>Session 3</b><br />Once more, we had a few new players, so we similarly had them quickly create drakes and jumped right in on the scene with Barge in his home, a massive tower. Also there were Thornsnout and Comet, the youngest Council member, from House Kebros. The three elders were at their wit's end, knowing that Valketh had put out a call to all the creatures touched by the Darkness throughout Dragonia, summoning them to her as her army. Even some of the young dragons were pulled. What's more, Tass was moving for a vote to name himself The First Dragon, a measure he claimed was necessary in this time of crisis.<br /><br />At the insistence of the young dragons, Comet revealed the existence of the Kebros enclave, devoted to understanding and internalizing the Darkness, to living with it instead of against it. Barge in turn spoke about ancient defenses in the capital city that hadn't been activated in an age, necessary now as Valketh approached with her army. And all the while, the young dragons contemplated Barge's warning – that young Valketh could be sent into battle against the older, corrupted Valketh, and might even win the fight, but only at the cost of her own young life.<br /><br />The clutches dispersed to attend to the greatest threats. One clutch went to reactive the city's defenses. Another went to sway Council members, to ensure that Tass would not win his vote. A third went out to the dark enclave, to learn what they could in hopes that they might remove the Darkness from Valketh without a fight being necessary.<br /><br />The clutch that went to activate the city's defenses encountered a catacombs of circuits and tunnels, left in disrepair by a draconic population that did not think it would need these measures again. Monsters of darkness had taken up residence in a dark pool of water in those catacombs, and they battled with those creatures, while <b>the brave Daredevil sacrificed himself by taking on the Shadow meant for others and going into his shadowself.</b> In his shadowself, he rushed forward and accidentally connected the broken link between one of the moonstones at the city’s perimeter and the central structure, inadvertently repairing it. After encountering a caretaker dragon and convincing him to help them with their tasks, they found a Mystic dragon who told them to call upon the moons to reactivate the defenses. When they all called upon the moons together, a massive shield of moon magic grew from the glass umbrella over standing over the capital, and the entire city was encased in a dome of energy connecting the glass tower to the moon pillars surrounding the capital.<br /><br />The clutch that went to sway the councilors found those councilors obstinate and sure in their ways, confident they knew exactly how to serve Dragonia best, and that it was at Tass's side. But through guile, subterfuge, and gumption, the drakes swayed the councilors. First, they gifted a beautiful piece of art, a branch made of five different kinds of wood, but in a single solid smooth piece, to one of the Councilors. After imbuing it with moon magic so it would grow fruit, the Councilor was swayed by the beauty and meaning of their piece, and agreed not to vote for Tass. Then, they snuck into Myndoth's archives in the city, stealing the secrets of that House, and found out secretly recorded conversations between the Councilor of Rothscar and Tass, in which Tass agreed to funnel funding to Rothscar so they could build new, great wonders, instead of funneling it to places where it was needed. Upon revealing that information to Rothscar's own house workers, <b>the young drakes led a march to Rothscar's Councilor, and demanded she change her vote.</b> Impressed by their resourcefulness, she agreed, and Tass was guaranteed not to have enough votes to become First Dragon.<br /><br />And finally, the clutch that went to the enclave of the Kebros dragons discovered that yes, it did exist! The dragons there had learned to live with the Darkness, claiming that it was not to the good of Dragonia to destroy the Darkness. Instead, it was better to come to terms with the Darkness. This was an argument that had some sway with those among them who were closer to the Darkness already, but it did not deter them from their goal. They were able to get the dragons of the enclave to give them an orb. It could trap Valketh within, and maybe push the Darkness inside of her, such that she might be free from its strongest corruptive influence. It was the best plan they had…but first, they decided to hatch another scheme. They spoke to Tass, and convinced him that <b>if he truly wanted to take control of Dragonia he would have to prove he was capable of doing so…by standing up to Valketh in single combat.</b> The dragons of the enclave would fuel Darkness into Valketh, strengthening her in her fight against Tass so he would be sure to fall, and then once he was gone, they would capture Valketh in the orb. Tass took the bait, and rushed off to fight the dark champion.<br /><br />When all was said and done, it came down to a final battle for the city. The army of Valketh attacked, and the young drakes faced the decision of whether or not to send young Valketh into battle. They did, knowing that she would likely perish, thinking that it would help, and that Valketh was eager to do her duty. The battle raged, with Tass falling to Valketh, and the city's defenses spewing forth moon magic to keep the dark monsters at bay, while the drakes themselves participated. In the end, the city was devastated by the battle, left crushed and ruined. While there were not many casualties, Dragonia's capital was no more. This left the whole of Dragonia questioning whether there even needed to be a Council anymore. Valketh was swept into the orb, along with her younger self, and after a seemingly interminable time, young Valketh was the only one to return. She would not speak of what happened, though she seemed…different. She then assumed the responsibility of helping Dragonia to rebuild.<br /><br />We did epilogues for the remaining drakes, hearing about their endings, some bittersweet (like the Seer who stayed with the dark enclave to learn more about the Darkness), some hopeful (like the dragon who agreed to watch over the now returned Valketh, and eventually found himself falling in love with her), and some determined (like the noble warriors who took up the task of recreating the capital, better than ever). But the Second War against the Darkness had been averted…at least, for now.<br /><br /><b>Concluding Thoughts</b><br />All in all, it was a grand time! The newest rules for Epyllion worked fantastically, and although there were a few areas that needed to be tightened, the bottom line was that they formed a very, very strong base for the game, and wouldn't need any more major tweaks! The changes to the playbooks led to fun, enjoyable characters, and the stories were involving and heroic!<br /><br />Some key learnings:<br />- Even though the epic battles were awesome, Epyllion doesn't actually need them, and in some ways works better without them. It's not about charging into a massive battle against an enormous terrifying dragon (at least, not all the time); it's about standing up for what is right, and talking to dragons, and solving problems through more than just fighting. We realized that keeping things a bit more restrained might've been the better move, even though we had a great time.<br /><br />- The ending of the entire LongCon was a little rushed. This was partly just due to time constraints, but there was a bit more to do with thinking about how to span out the epic conclusion so that it felt a bit less like a montage, where you don’t' actually get to sink your claws into the major events.<br /><br />- The maturation of the dragons over the story led to an excellent overall arc, which was awesome! When new dragons kept coming in in later sessions, but the dragons from the first session were now older, it only led to some fantastic dynamics between them. The dragons really felt like they were growing up!<br /><br />All in all, it was very much a success, and made us all the more excited to bring Epyllion out to everyone!",

Even when they aren't.<br /><br />Name: Captain Shoalwing<br />House: Tessith<br />Age: Bearded Dragon<br />Colors: Glistening aquamarine and seafoam scales<br />Looks: <br />Shoalwing is a muscular dragon, with an enormous wingspan that dwarfs her whip tail and long snout. Her iridescent coat shines seafoam and aquamarine, and her tiny horns are almost an afterthought.<br /><br />'Captain' Shoalwing as she's known commands one of the massive coastal barges House Tessith uses as stopover points for traveling dragons. With the sails down, a full sized elder can land on board - Albeit, not leaving room for much else. She delights in telling scary stories about the ocean and krakens to young drakes, but is only so good at giving them a scare because she's a little afraid herself. <br /><br />Shoalwing loves traveling and will take any excuse for a long, soaring flight over the water; She usually wears a rigging-like harness, to make it easy for smaller dragons to hitch a ride, and carrying a clutch of drakes is almost effortless with her huge wings. She secretly wonders around the krakens, and won't admit it, but wants to take a risk and sail out into the sea just to see if there truly is anything out there. <br /><br />In my game, Shoalwing and her ship took the clutch from the southern cliffside city of Rabaton to Gemport, a mine and shipyard in the northeastern archipelago. She told some scary stories but also gave the clutch a lot of hope with her pep-talks and adventuresome spirit. ",

I'm not sure ultimately what format is useful, but figured posting a few could help others, and get some feedback.<br /><br />Up first is the 'helpful' professor from the GenCon Epy game, Sy.<br /><br />Name: Professor Sy<br />House: Kebros<br />Age: Longtooth Dragon<br />Colors: Inky Black with red highlights<br />Looks: Sleek, scaly body with talons, a pointy snout, two rows of horns, and a stinger<br /><br />Professor Sy is a smooth, inky Longtooth dragon loyal to house Kebros. He has two rows of horns get longer as they go back from his forehead, and he has red highlights on his wings and face. He has been known to bring an entire courtyard of playing drakes to a dead stop with his severe expression and unamused demeanor.<br /><br />Sy is a sought after academic on matters of the Stone Moon, but his true calling (and regular job) is the education of young drakes that house Kebros deems as 'Gifted' in prophecy (such as seers) and in some cases, poaching such gifted youth from the other houses.<br /><br />Sy is never seen without his harness and his black bag, which he guards jealously and often rummages in or idly rifles through. Whatever he keeps inside seems to be abnormally heavy for its size.<br /><br />In my game, Sy stumbled across a rambunctious clutch playing in snow of the Blackrock Academy's courtyard, and decided that they all, including his Kebros student, Draven, needed something to do. He sent them to fetch him a sample of black fluid at the bottom of a well in a mountain cave - A task complicated when a spooky giant owl abducted their talkative friend Rollatha. ",
