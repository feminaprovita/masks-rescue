    "content": "I said I'd give a play report so here it is!<br /><br />Our Bride:<br />Fatale, Virgin, and Witch.<br />Insecure about her <b>short hair</b>, <b>smile</b>, and <b>eyes</b>. Afraid that she wouldn't get any time alone anymore, that she would be stuck at home and no longer be able to have adventure, and that she would lose her simple lifestyle in the face of Bluebeard's riches.<br /><br />Bluebeard's favorite present was a balm, to rub on his aching muscles (the player keyed into the fact that the cover art makes Bluebeard look like a romance novel and is probably pretty sore from working out) presented to him by The Witch.<br /><br />We had some great moments while we were playing. The players felt sympathetic towards the other brides in most cases. Every time they <b>Shivered in Fear</b> was a personal triumph for me since it felt like I was hitting the right notes of \"Oh man... that is fucked up.&quot;<br /><br />We visited a Dressing Room (Body: Beauty Standards), a Solarium (Sexuality: Nymphomania), and a Chapel (Religion: Underworld). The accumulated 3 Disloyalty Tokens at that point and decided to run away so we did not enter the Final Room (Motherhood: Grief). I opted for a mansion that didn't make sense, hallways that go on forever, time that doesn't make sense or is impossible to track, doors that you entered in one hallway but upon exiting are in a different part of the house... I like dream imagery and I wanted to do that in this mansion. One of my players (The Fatale) kept giving me these weird looks as I described that there was no internal consistency to the mansion, as if the longer they stayed there, it would somehow make sense. It amuses me when they're like that. lol<br /><br />The keys they described were pretty cool too. The Fatale described a &quot;Gold plated, rhinestone encrusted, pristine key with a curling vine motif&quot; and the Virgin described a &quot;black and grey key that appears to somehow be made of marble with a ring made of gold. It feels glossy and carries the slight smell of sandalwood.&quot; The player had a moment where they were like &quot;can a key have a smell?&quot; and I had to remind them that they're in a mansion that has an unknowable floor plan and is full of the ghosts of his husbands murdered ex-wives. It was kindof funny. Overall, I was super impressed and humbled by their willingness to jump in and give me all their creativity and buy-in on this one since horror games are always a little bit of a long shot.<br /><br />Some notes on my own Groundskeeping that I would like to improve:<br />- I would like to get better about building a rooms tension by just describing it and a couple objects inside. I found myself showing the horror/servant a little to early instead of letting the tension build through investigation. I will definitely write up some notes to help me stay organized with room generation next time since that seems to take a little longer than I want it to at the table (given my inexperience) and I spent a lot of time shuffling through papers.<br />- I would also like to play the game in person next time. We played online and the environment was not as curated as I wanted it to be.<br />- Next time, before we start and as I'm giving our safety talks, I'm going to do Lines and Veils that way I have a clearer idea of where I can push and not.<br /><br />Notes that I got back from the players:<br />- They want to play again.<br />- They liked that <b>Shiver from Fear</b> triggers when the player at the table has a physical reaction.<br />- They liked the Shattered Bride mechanic and were disappointed that The Fatale shattered just as we filled our last token.<br />- They also really liked the epilogue questionnaire. I liked the epilogue questionnaire <b>so much</b> that I'll probably start using it for the games I'm planning one shots for.<br />- I really liked the directive to describe with all 5 senses. Doing so really allows you to draw out the tension and wrongness of a room either by accentuating it by one sense that can detect something off or by peppering in little things to multiple senses. It's a great practice and I'm going to start using it more in the other games I run.<br />- I found myself repeating motifs <b>not</b> normally included in the book (doors, keys, and the color gold). Specifically I ended up using a lot of flower imagery based on the fact that the players decided that they gave Bluebeard a crown of wildflowers as a wedding gift and that he had given her a bouquet of exotic flowers for the same reason. I found that the repetition of the different elements in the game heightens the state of dreaminess the narrative has and that's an amazing quality I want to start taking into my other games.<br /><br />What a great game! I can probably push the envelope more next time. People got to an uncomfortable place but not one they couldn't handle, which felt good, and I got to stretch the limits of what I as a GM (and a man) have explored before. Thank you to +Whitney Beltrán +Sarah Doombringer and Marissa Kelly for making this amazing game!",

In the two games I have run we have gotten through a maximum of three rooms (plus the final room). They have been 4 hour slots. Do you just remind them early and often that they can propose a truth at any time? Do you point out that it is really in <b>their</b> hands to decide what happened in the room - ie their interpretation could be entirely different from what the Groundskeeper had been thinking?",

If you give the ring to another sister without being forced to, you're immune to trauma until the next time the ring changes hands.<br /><br />*When you shiver with fear, you have two options, as described on the move sheet. If you pick two, you can keep the ring. If you pick one, you have to pass the ring.<br /><br />One of the great elements for me of the game is that ring moves give you narrative influence, but should almost always backfire. I played Friday night as the witch and almost got shattered in the first room from trying to be overly aggressive with ring moves, and later used my Viper face and IMMEDIATELY regretted it. The rest of the sisters were playing a bit 'holier than though' and I stood in as a wiser protector for them, but had to give up spotlight quickly when it was clear I was making things worse."

We just finished a second game with the Witch, the Animus and the Virgin. The game ended with the Witch standing alone, her sisters shattered (reading the text together is really neat). The Bride was on the very edge of madness at the end.<br /><br />A lot of bleed out and some dark dark stuff... It helps to play with people you trust :)<br /><br />I have a few questions though :<br />• When the Animus takes a Trauma because of her face &quot;The Shield&quot;, can she decide that every sister takes Trauma as well (we ruled that yes, because the sisters were realising that their protector was failing) ?<br />• About the Witch : why is the face &quot;The Viper&quot; restricted to Servants and can't apply to horrors as well ?<br />• Can you voluntarily pass the ring at anytime ?<br />• Obviously, when you shiver with fear and take one trauma because of it, you don't have to pass the ring, right ?<br /><br />Remarks :<br />• The questions about the keys which were swapped with Agenda/principles/moves are awesome sauce.<br />• I really hope the GM section of the game brings some real advice on how to run this game.<br /><br />In the end, we were all impressed by how elegant the game is and how far it led us.",

These are oneshots.<br /><br />Bluebeard’s Bride is a tabletop roleplaying game of supernatural horror set in a familiar fairy tale. The tale starts simply enough: one room in Bluebeard’s house is forbidden to the Bride. She eventually falls prey to her curiosity and opens it, discovering gruesome evidence that reveals her husband to be a killer of women. The game you play with this book is different—you and your friends explore the rooms of Bluebeard’s home as his Bride, creating your own beautifully tragic version of the dark fairy tale.

The completed draft of the Bluebeard book text has been sent to dev editing!<br /><br />The three of us are very proud that we've come this far on the journey. It all started with two strangers sitting down at a game jam (+Sarah Richardson and me!) with +Marissa Kelly there to assist wayward game designers. Sarah and I both said that we loved fairy tales. I had an idea to do Bluebeard and Sarah and I instantly connected on it. Marissa got sucked in while trying to help us figure out how to structure it.<br /><br />By the end of the jam it gripped all of us so hard that we knew we couldn't let it go. We knew it was <i>ours</i>. The three of us have brought very different but integral elements to the creation of this game. Together, we've definitely made something better than any of us would have on our own.<br /><br />We can't wait to set this thing loose on the world. Thanks to the Bluebeard community for all your support and enthusiasm. This little horror is gonna get born! &lt;3",

I think they are gorgeous and certainly wonderfully inspirational just from reading and looking at the pictures, but I have problems imagining them in an actual game. <br /><br />The only option that seems kind of obvious to me is drawing a card or two as inspirations if I'm hard-pressed to interpret a key description. But if I already have an idea (which I mostly do because the key rule works sooo well! =D), it might be hard to bring in another influence, especially a random one, and still create a coherent and thematic room. And if I take out the random factor, I will essentially use these decks as an inspirational sourcebook (like the book of rooms), which seems ... kind of wasted on the card format, if that makes any sense? ^^''<br /><br />What are your thoughts?",

They begin talking about their job and the difficulties they face in calling balls and strikes. The first umpire states quite confidently, “There’s balls and there’s strikes, and I call them as they are!” The second umpire, with a slight look of disapproval, says, “No, no, no, there’s balls and there’s strikes, and I call them as I seem ’em.” The third umpire says, “You know, you’re both wrong.

Like 10-15m and just figure things out during that time.<br /><br />Also: taking your time and thinking about things in silence at the table, especially with horror games, actually <b>adds</b> to the experience. So if you aren't sure immediately how to react to something just quietly think for a few seconds - let the players feel the anxiety."

    "content": "I ran Bluebeard's Bride for the first time last night and it went ok. Just ok. I'm not too proud to say that I struggled sometimes and I'm wondering if people have any great ideas for making it easier. <br /><br />More than anything, I struggled with the amount of improvisation the game requires. Based on my reading of the core rules, rooms are to be generated spontaneously once keys are described, as are the room threats, and any servants or horrors therein. This is A LOT when you're trying to tie room design to key descriptions and threats to wedding preparation. Additionally, you have to be prepared to answer complex questions potentially depending on what moves the sisters take - e.g., why did Bluebeard keep this? What memories does this object hold? <br /><br />It was a real struggle for me at times to keep all the balls in the air when manufacturing everything out of whole cloth. What have folks found to make this easier? Are there any pieces that can be done ahead of time to make things easier? ",

It led to a tight story with them depending on each other a lot. My sisters were the Fatale and the Animus, and they had different outlooks but also came together to face the horrors. It was very neat. Still, I think having more sisters will bring complications that add flavor to the game. I question whether a 1 on 1 game would bring the level of complexity needed to make the game sing, but would love to hear how that sort of game goes."

I think my anxiety comes from the list of rooms and threats providing a really daunting number of possibilities, and narrowing down to the point where I can do something on the fly always gets me a tiny bit nervous. Here's what I currently have in mind:<br /><br />I'll draw out a sketch of about 5 rooms with threats, and maybe a couple servants it could be fun to bring in. During wedding prep, listen intently to the players and circle 2 or 3 of my ideas that fit really well with what they bring to the table. Hit those ones first, call a bathroom break after you've used them up, and use the lead time to come up with enough additional rooms to get to the end.<br /><br />From my experiences, the players' first impulse is almost always to go to a master bedroom to find more comfortable shoes and clothes and to freshen up after a long journey, so you need something that fills that spot and has some elements to help frame the style of the game. Because the groundskeeper gets to pick the player who describes the first key, they can pick someone who is likely to describe something they prepped well for. <br /><br />It seems like character creation is really focused on helping the groundskeeper determine what the players will find scary, there's just a considerable time pressure to bring those fears to life quickly. When done well, the game works an amazing kind of magic trick, like a traditional forced card. The sisters create all the content, it just feels like the groundskeeper did."

Looking over the prerelease I have a question:<br /><br />For the Martyr move &quot;When you offer forgiveness for a sister’s sins, mark trauma, 1 for 2, to heal that sister.&quot; Does that mean that the Mother takes 2 Trauma to heal 1 Trauma of another sister or is it the reverse that the Mother takes 1 Trauma to heal 2 Trauma? The former is powerful. The latter is heavy but possibly fine.<br /><br />Also more of a game design question for +Whitney Beltrán, any reason why you choose to have the only thing that rolls are used for is the Ring Moves? I ask as I could totally see moves like the Martyr move and the Bear move be more interesting with a bit of randomness. For instance, The Bear move could be rewritten as &quot;When a Sister incurs trauma, you can step in and punish the sister who truly deserves it. Roll + Carnality. On a hit the guilty sister to marks trauma instead, on a 7-9, and mark 1 for yourself as well, as your failure to prevent this is self evident.&quot;<br />",

An instant later &quot;This is mine...&quot;. When you turn back, you see a beautiful woman. Her hair is dark and her skin is as fair as porcelaine. She smells as lavender. She has a [insert the opposite of the Bride's flaw] and she is wearing a red silk dress, as red as the gore on the hairbrush&quot;.<br /><br />First case : I did narrate the answer without making a move, but then the character can investigate further.

To my mind, it is what is at the core of a pbta game.<br /><br />As you say, the game takes explicit buy-in. But in my opinion, it is a prerequisite for all horror games.<br /><br />The thing I find disturbing is this : the game demands from the players to put themselves in danger. And a &quot;good&quot; player should always consider placing its character in danger for the sake of the narrative. But usually, to push the player to the right direction, there is a stick, or better yet, a carrot for him to do so. I can't see neither of them in the game.<br /><br />Even if there is no mechanical motivation, there should be a fictional one. After two rooms where serious sh*t happens to you, why wouldn't you just run the heck out of this creepy place ?<br /><br />If everyone bought in those things, fine. But it is a hard bargain... <br /><br />I am not trying to diminished the game or anything. I have to say, I cannot wait to play for it. But I really do hope those blanks in my head get filled."

        "content": "I think my nerves come from separating telling a story with the players, as opposed to doing things to their characters. My exposure to the game comes from listening to actual plays and playing with +Sarah Richardson, and in those experiences, I've had the impression of a social contract that says, in effect, &quot;You're going to participate in some really dark stuff playing this game, but we're all agreeing to it because we collectively know that this story is reflective of the real world.&quot; I want to be very careful in running the game that, as a cis-white-hetero male, I can still maintain that social contract without turning into an oppressor figure. At the same time, there's a risk of going too far with that caution and making the story toothless.<br /><br />One of the ways I've tried to avoid misogyny and the male gaze in horror games I've run is by very specifically focusing on action and consequence. Bad things happen in reaction to the PC's decisions, not in spite of them, so there's still a sense of agency. I'd love to hear more on how to create a safe space where everyone feels they can go deep into the darkness but they have a life-line to pull themselves back out.<br /><br />I'm in the habit of introducing the X card in any games with heavy bleed or dark subject material, but I've yet to be at a table where someone actually utilized it. Any advice on getting players more comfortable with using that out when they feel uncomfortable?<br /><br />I hope I'm being a little more clear, kind of rambled a bit here."

        "content": "+Sarah Richardson, +Marissa Kelly, and +Whitney Beltrán have a lot more experience running Bluebeard's Bride than I do... but I did run it for the three of them during one of the early playtests. I was certainly aware of the dynamic that +Vincent Eaton described (&quot;I'm a man running this horror game for three women&quot;), but the system, even in an early draft, did a really great job of supporting my work as the MC.<br /><br />Basically, I look to the moves to guide play... and the designers have already done a lot of work for us by giving us tools in those moves to escalate in ways that are in keeping with the kind of fiction they want to generate. In other words, trust that the game is structured to a specific experience and play towards it!<br /><br />Specifically, it meant that I created themed rooms, filled those rooms with objects, and then let the players do the work of signaling what interested them. I didn't force anything on them; like any good horror story, the protagonist chooses their own doooooom. All I had to do was make sure that the escalations (&quot;Now the dog thing is looking at you...&quot;) were in keeping with the fiction that the game demands.<br /><br />At the same time, those safety tools are key. I usually try to demonstrate using the X-Card myself during the first hour or so of a game to make sure players get used to using it, and I am really explicit before playing something like Bluebeard's Bride about the content and tone. I need people onboard 100% before we go into this kind of horror experience."

I'm also basically always the GM of these sorts of things. It occurs to me that given the themes and tone, all female players/male GM might be a really weird dynamic. I was curious if it's been done or if anyone has any thoughts about it. It's quite possible this one wouldn't be for my crew anyway, so it's more of an idle thought than a big problem to solve, but I am curious. ",

For those in the game's design team, you've created a fascinating game that I can't wait to get my hands on once the Kickstarter concludes and rewards eventually go out.<br /><br />I did download the PDFs offered in the backer update, and I would like to play the game a time or two with my friends who play tabletop games. I'm listening to one of the Podcasts that features Sarah as GM/Groundskeeper, and I'm slowly working through one of the videos. From what I can tell, as GM you essentially choose one of the rooms from the list, choose a potential threat in the room, and weave the story accordingly? So if the Bride picks a key and the GM has her enter the Dining Room (as an example), the GM has the Sister describe the key, and the GM would describe the room, then eventually work to the threat and weave the story that way.<br /><br />It's also my first venture into a horror RPG like this. Does anyone have tips? Thanks!",

Are these suppose to be NPC's that are residing in rooms or are they able to move from room to room?

        "content": "Posted with permission from +Mick Bradley<br />--------------<br /><br />My Elaboration and Riff on +Seth Harris Overview of Playing Bluebeard's Bride<br /><br />--- I am giving this post a trigger warning for various issues of abuse and such, because I'm about to write stuff I've not written or talked much about before. ---<br /><br />I've been really enjoying the game overviews that Seth Harris has been writing on his blog the past few days. My enjoyment comes partly because he's my friend, partly because he's just a damn good writer, and partly because I was at the table for most of the games he's been covering and I like comparing his impressions to mine.<br /><br />This one about playing Bluebeard's Bride is especially good. It turns out to be a great launching point for one of the things about the game - and the specific session we played - that I couldn't quite articulate properly until Seth wrote his post and unlocked some blockages in my noggin.<br /><br />In the penultimate paragraph of his post, Seth wrote this:<br /><br />&quot;A good GM would need to be agile in making sure the content strongly affects the players without venturing into territory that would bring up personal traumas.&quot;<br /><br />My purpose here is not to disagree with that statement but rather to riff off of it a bit.<br /><br />First, I'll say that yes, I believe that anyone who wants to competently run Bluebeard's Bride needs to be pretty darn agile, and should avoid intentionally mashing peoples' trauma triggers without permission. But in general, the idea of venturing into territory that would bring up personal traumas is something over which the person running the game has only a little control - which is why there is the X Card.<br /><br />When she ran the game for us, +Sarah Richardson made a very explicit point to encourage the use of the X Card. In fact, instead of just putting one in the center of the table she put one in easy reach of each player, reducing the potential barrier of someone feeling too embarrassed to have to lean in and reach across the table. And she made it very clear that shit was very likely to get real and we NEEDED to use the card if we got more uncomfortable than we thought was safe. Never in any of my games has the intended safety net of the X Card been so clearly and explicitly pointed out.<br /><br />Later I discussed this with +Marissa Kelly and she explained that both she and Sarah had been burned in previous Bluebeard's Bride game sessions they'd run by people who chose not to use the X Card - even though it was available - but still got upset after the game and complained of being traumatized.<br /><br />Anyhow, Sarah's very clear and explicit groundwork-laying was a very big part of what made me feel like I could finally really just open my brain to the psychic maelstrom of play. And it isn't so much because I felt like I might need to use the X Card, but because I was able to trust, thanks to Sarah, that anyone else who needed to use it would do so in the event that I did or said something unintentionally shitty.<br /><br />I'm going to open up about some stuff here in the hopes of pointing out how a proper use of the X Card - and a really clear laying of the groundwork for its purpose, especially in games like this - can free people up to explore in a very &quot;I will not abandon you&quot; kind of social contract way. My decision to write about this comes from the part of Seth's statement quoted above where he says, &quot;without venturing into territory that would bring up personal traumas&quot;.<br /><br />The thing is, Bluebeard's Bride, I think, is built to explore traumas, to engage them, and to maybe even therapeutically work through them as a group, in some cases. And the game we played last week at Games on Demand specifically reached right into some of my own personal traumas. Big Time. Like, I'm not kidding. And I ended up being very okay with that.<br /><br />Here is a very oversimplified surface exposition of my childhood experience.<br />1. Abandonment by my mother before I was old enough to remember her.<br />2. Excessive physical violence in my childhood household, including physical abuse from my father.<br />3. Childhood sexual abuse from a &quot;trusted&quot; caregiver<br />4. Emotional abuse that was rife with threats for me to side with this or that family member in their constant war with one another over whatever the hell they wanted to fight about.<br />5. Other stuff that was scary and traumatic, resulting in a lifetime of me needing therapy to try to cope.<br /><br />Overall, as a little kid I was in a space where I had no adults I could really trust, no real safe space to hide (except in books and fantasies) and no way out of it. It was a helpless and hopeless situation.<br /><br />So yeah, I know what it feels like to be live in a highly unstable nightmare-scape where every door you open or every move you make might mean a fist or a belt or a tirade about your failure to have been born a girl like everyone was hoping.<br /><br />When we played a scene in the game where The Bride gets held down and forcefully impregnated, well, I don't know what it feels like to be impregnated but I know the rest of that scenario. And when we played a scene where one of the ghosts was a woman who tried to placate Bluebeard by being proper and pretty, that tapped into something I've got some personal familiarity with, too.<br /><br />Before I go on, it's important to me that I point out I'm not trying to equate my experience with the experience of non-men who endure these kinds of things. Because the difference is, of course, that I got to grow up and get out of the situation, so that even though it's still a big issue for me internally, my white maleness allows me the privilege of not having to keep experiencing it as a societal imposition upon my selfhood, whereas women and other non-male people continue to have to face it as an ongoing thing. So yes, it's a big friggin deal to me but it doesn't give me the right to jump into conversations and throw my pain around and it CERTAINLY IS NOT meant to be taken as me saying that if I can have this shit happen in my childhood and don't need trigger warnings and all that, then why does anyone else need them? I repeat, I am not saying that and I don't believe it. Everyone's journey is their own, and where you set boundaries, I will do my very best to respect and honor them.<br /><br />That being said, I, personally, actually crave situations where my traumas - and those of my peers to the level of whatever boundaries they choose - can be pushed on and prodded and worked through in a trusting space through play. It feels kind of odd using the word &quot;play&quot; in this context but I've learned from good people that that's what it is. Play is an important way of practicing for life. And although it is generally supposed to be fun, it can also often be challenging and even difficult.<br /><br />I'm not entirely sure how to wrap this up, except to say that Bluebeard's Bride was one of the very momentous and significant experiences of my gaming life thus far, and I owe that to Sarah and Marissa and +Whitney Beltrán for making this incredible exploration into the kind of horror and trauma that this old French tale represents. I also owe it to Sarah for running it so masterfully and so invitingly. And I owe it to my fellow players as well. Finally, I want to thank Seth Harris for writing his post because it was an essential component that unlocked my ability to talk about it the way I have above.<br /><br />And unlike Seth, I absolutely would play it again. Maybe I'm a glutton for punishment, I don't know, but yeah, I would, and I will.<br /><br />But only with the right people."
