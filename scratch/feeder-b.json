    "content": "Latest Masks RPG session saw the B-Team get deeply into trouble while the Salvatores were off-world. It started simply enough: Kevin (The Beacon) got a mission to extract an undercover reporter from a gang war. He suited up and called in his semi-allies...<br /><br />Craig, a.k.a. Glow-rion (The Delinquent), was in it mostly to get his hands on more of the superpower drug Invictus. He stretched his powers to create a psychic rocket launcher and to musically befuddle a knock-off Chopbuster. But ultimately, he learned that huffing a burning cloud of Invictus is unwise, and began to re-evaluate his life.<br /><br />Adonis (The Star), now sporting a dark cape and mohawk, had a new scheme to get his acclaim-based powers back. He tried endearingly to cultivate an edgier persona, and did get a gang of Vaudvillains to believe he was his own evil twin, Tammuz.<br /><br />For Red Cent (The Reformed), it was a personal mission. Her step-dad Bounty is the drug dealer under siege...turns out it's part of his plan to fake his death and leave the biz. The two come to an understanding—just in time to team up against RC's old mentor, Penny Dreadnought.<br /><br />Kevin (as Sir Percival of Capstone) completed the mission with a Moment of Truth, stealing Bounty's ride to whisk reporter Abby Rhoades to safety. The rest of the team collapsed into recriminations and double-crosses over the Invictus supply, ultimately destroying it. Huzzah?",

    "content": "Yesterday's Masks RPG was a doozy. Not one, but two Moments of Truth, plus the team faced the menace of the Calamity Crew, a black ops team of collared supervillains dispatched to bring them in...with several members nursing personal grudges against them.<br /><br />Panic (The Doomed) discovered that her missing classmate Nadia was actually the speedster supervillain Spatterdash, locked up in a F.A.T.E. prison. Panic used her Moment of Truth to spring Spatterdash, and other kids she thought were being held in unjust conditions.<br /><br />Halfpenny (The Transformed) learned to shift between his monstrous and human forms, but also faced consequences of signing over control of his body to the sinister Mr. Hunt for 14min, 40sec a day. He learned that, controlled by Hunt, he'd authorized an attack on a teammate's mom!<br /><br />General Bowmaster (The Beacon) raced to City Hall to save his mom, the deputy mayor. He bonded with his dad along the way, but when they arrived his mom seemed hypnotized, and Bowmaster leapt into the sinister painting that was responsible—only to be captured by evil forces!<br /><br />In the Calamity Crew ambush, Sonia (The Soldier) traded blows with Chopbuster, only to realize to her chagrin he was Jim Keaton (a man she'd paralyzed) in an experimental power suit. Fleeing the fight, unleashing her powers, she turned utterly into flame—and was snuffed out!<br /><br />Torq's (The Nova) reality-warping Moment of Truth sent the Calamity Crew packing, though not before he learned that Uproar was an alien whose homeworld had been wiped out by Torq's own former homeworld. It seemed like the Salvatores, minus 2 members, had a hard-won victory...<br /><br />...But you can't fight F.A.T.E. forever, and the law caught up to our heroes, with every single PC captured at the end of the session. Who will save them?
