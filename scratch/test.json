  "content": "Yesterday's Masks session saw the team sail off-world in a bone ship powered by uncomfortable truths, hoping to rescue an old-school supervillain (who could be a useful ally) from the clutches of the Rime Court. Plus, one of my players set a new bar for cosplay!<br /><br />Sonia (The Soldier) stayed on mission and also blasted off an ice-dragon's wing. Panic (The Doomed) sacrificed a tooth to a skeleton to get here, and accidentally stabbed Halfpenny (The Transformed) through the soul with a bone sword (he got better).<br /><br />Torq (The Nova) cleverly avoided drinking liquid nostalgia at a Rime Court soiree with a careful application of gravity control inside his esophagus. General Bowmaster (The Legacy) put on a show to create a distraction, but got so into the role his fae mask wouldn't come off.<br /><br />In the end, the team reached the room where Baron Devastation was enthroned/imprisoned, only to see masses of Rime Court Hunters pouring in as well. To be continued...next weekend!",
