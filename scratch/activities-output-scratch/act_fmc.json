In fact if this playbook is in the mix, don&#39;t let the Janus in the game. The thematic overlap is too much.<br /><br />2. Alternately, it seems like this could be another axis of responsibility for the Janus. Instead of a standalone playbook (&quot;Don&#39;t write playbooks.&quot; - JDCorley on every PBTA game forum) you could do a revised version of the Janus that has Persona responsibilities instead of mundane responsibilities, and have it run off Freak or Superior depending on how people are approaching it. This has the advantage of already having a lot of &quot;changing identity&quot; moves built in."

        "content": "When I think of a superhero taking on another identity, I typically think of the Robin and Red-X story from Teen Titans. Unfortunately, The Persona playbook doesn&#39;t capture this concept very well. Which is a shame because I believe this playbook is really trying to capture that kind of story.<br /><br />The Persona features a very different conflict from what you could call its &#39;sister&#39; playbook, The Janus. A Janus&#39; core story is about trying to figure out whether they are truly their Mask or their Civilian identity, and perhaps discovering along the way that they&#39;re actually a third person they hadn&#39;t considered who is a mix of both. The Persona, on the other hand, knows exactly who they are, but also knows that there is a need for them to be someone different, because there are just some things that their Base self isn&#39;t capable of doing.<br /><br />Robin isn&#39;t a criminal, or a villain, or even a bad person. But in the Red-X story, he wants so badly to take down Slade, that he&#39;s willing to go against himself. He steals, lies, betrays/hurts his friends, and makes the Red-X suit with the dangerous and illegal Xenothium. All just so he can get closer to Slade. In other words, the &#39;ends justify the means&#39;.<br /><br />For starters, I wish The Persona was more focused on this kind of story, to the point of their Persona always being a villain or severe anti-hero identity.<br /><br />Next, it&#39;s pretty telling how betrayed the Teen Titans felt in the Red-X story. They knew Robin as their honest leader, and suddenly they discovered a whole new side of him. There were harsh consequences, Robin lost their trust, and I wish this was reflected in the playbook. Unlike the Janus, who is encouraged to reveal their identity, and rewarded for doing so; the Persona should be encouraged to keep it hidden, rewarding them for doing so, and to the point of punishing them if they are found out.<br /><br />This would be a good backstory question, &quot;What kind of terrible consequences will there be if you&#39;re discovered to be the same person as your Persona?&quot;<br /><br />I&#39;m also of the mind that the Persona should mostly work in the &#39;gutters&#39;. Where instead of the player directly acting as the Persona, they announce things that the Persona has already done or will do. So that, in the actual gameplay, it really does seem like the Base and Persona are two separate people, with only little hints linking them together. And then, when the Persona themselves actually appears in a scene, there&#39;s a lot more punch to it.<br /><br />An example, &quot;When entering a scene, you can declare that your Persona was here earlier. Roll +your Persona&#39;s label. On a 10+, Name a nefarious thing they did that makes something you&#39;re doing now easier, take +1 forward. On a 7-9...&quot;<br /><br />Food for thought. There really should be an element of betrayal of trust to all this. With perhaps moves like the Delinquent&#39;s &quot;Team? What Team?&quot; move. It&#39;d also be very interesting for the character to be able to take advantage of their Influences without actually surrendering said Influence, as long as they are in their Persona identity."

Labels are meant to shift. Can others shift it?<br /><br />The Moves are all about your Alter Ego. There&#39;s a fairly consistent build philosophy you can glean from the other Playbooks in print in that a Playbook (generally) has two moves that deal with the party. Two that deal with you and your place in the world and two that deal with your playbook specifically. It&#39;s not a hard and fast but I find it really helpful to think along those lines. <br /><br />Also, and this is just a formatting thing, moves are listed with the miss first, the 7-9 hit next and then the 10+. You&#39;ve  got it reversed and that&#39;s weird.<br /><br />That Bastard! is cute, it could work in some narrative senses but the things it gives you is crazy. Taking Potential as a base move? On a 7-9? Power Leveling much? Marking Potential on a Miss? Really? And just shifting labels? Every move seems to shift your Label for Alter Ego. Why? Why do you need that?<br /><br />There is nothing Bad Ass about Bad Ass Power. It&#39;s a giant, screaming liability, no one would take it. It actively hurts you if you spend Hold so why would you spend it? Nothing is forcing you to spend it so it&#39;s just a waste. And you have to use it, if you take it and you just wouldn&#39;t, every time you use your Alter Ego? Why are you punishing people for using their Alter Ego? That&#39;s the whole playbook. You can spend one to...take a Hard Move. Pass. Inflict a Condition (that is a hard move) so pass. Lose a Team from the Pool for no reason. HARD PASS. Oh. Lose all the Influences you have on the team. What? Who would pick any of this? My, goodness. Oh and hey, shift Alter Ego. Because why not.<br /><br />Leave the Veil is literally every other move but worse by merit of being just a label shift. <br /><br />Raise the Veil....just take Influence over someone! When the going gets tough, make a friend! So your rolls are better! This move isn&#39;t even short sighted. It&#39;s blind to the mechanics.<br /><br />You Know Nothing about Me is just a better (and worse!) version of I Don&#39;t Care What you Think. Because at least that&#39;s just a flat bonus that offsets a Condition at worst and at best is the only stand out thing about the Delinquent. But it&#39;s worse than that because with all the Label Shifting (ignoring that you&#39;re not going to be playing this Playbook for very long) it hurts you. <br /><br />Why do you hate the players so much man? This Playbook is like strapping razorblades to the inside of your pants. <br /><br />It&#39;s not Me is...hideously overpowered and all over the place. Unlocking your Moment of Truth on a 10+, marking a Condition on a 7-9 but not on a 1-6 which is a miss? There&#39;s so much shifting of your Label that just on a cursory glance you&#39;re going to hit a -3 or -4 rather swiftly. Why are you trying to punish the player for being in their Alter Ego when that&#39;s literally what the Playbook is all about?<br /><br />I hate to speak well of my own things but this is honestly just an anemic hack of the Persona in all ways, shapes and forms. The trouble doesn&#39;t stop there though. <br /><br />Why, as an Advance, would you get a Sanctuary? Is that just a formatting thing because you&#39;re using the Template you made for the Relic Playbook I shared?<br /><br />I do see one idea worth cribbing. The When the Team Came Together question. It needs some work because WTCT always bring the whole Team in. Something like &quot;We discovered something that incriminated my Persona. How do they feel about him and how did I distance myself from the evidence?&quot; I like that honestly. It also does make me consider that maybe the powers being separate isn&#39;t a fun mechanic and there should be some actual mechanics for being discovered and the consequences of that."

        "content": "Spent the morning looking over The Persona to give you more feedback :)<br /><br />Right off the bat, there should definitely be a second costume option under looks, so that you can define what your Alias looks like. Maybe the simplest way is to change &#39;costume&#39; to &#39;costumes&#39;? So if you choose simple costumes, it means that both your Hero and Alias identities wear a simple uniform.<br /><br />Next, under Identity, I think it would be great if the Labels were freed up. &#39;Pick a Label&#39; instead of &#39;choose X or Y&#39;. Imagine the spunky kid acrobat (Freak) becoming a piercing and manipulative mob boss-like figure by night (Mundane).<br /><br />Abilities... I like the selection, and Pick 2 is fine. But I wish the Alias ability was something that could <b>only</b> be used while you&#39;re in that identity (changing somehow activates it; maybe its gear you put on, a ritual, a certain mindset you adopt, etc.), and better, if it was described as being powerful, but forbidden and/or dangerous. Maybe even adding mechanical benefits and penalties to this ability, so using it has extra punch, while giving solid reason for The Persona to change into their Alias identity during play.<br /><br />&#39;Darkness&#39; is pretty neat. I like the idea of The Persona&#39;s objectives having a mechanical presence, and I think it&#39;s important that they are, but I also think that there are better ways to implement this. As it stands, it feels bloated, and too dependent on the player to make it work. For instance, having a player come up with five solid &#39;objectives&#39; during CC is a little much. Also! &#39;If a Teammate discovers...&#39; is weird, as it essentially tells another player what to do and think; don&#39;t do that. Even &#39;When someone close to you...&#39; isn&#39;t great, for the reason that it could potentially affect a PC and double up on the former &#39;If a Teammate&#39;.<br /><br />Moves... I really wish they were more about doing things that your other identity can&#39;t do! The two big themes of the playbook are &#39;doing bad things for a good cause&#39; and &#39;becoming someone else to do things you normally can&#39;t/won&#39;t do&#39;.<br /><br />- Devil or Angel on the Shoulder. It&#39;s kinda silly. I get it though. I doubt it&#39;d see much use in game.<br /><br />- Disguised as Another Dude. I feel like identity defense against Pierce should be more built-in. But also, what&#39;s the point of a lie or mislead? Pierces tend to be asked and answered OOCly, as the move specifically defines asking the player, instead of one character to another. Since it&#39;s all meta to begin with, and the other player knows that the Persona player is lying to them, eh... There&#39;s no reason for the player to believe it or take it to heart. It&#39;d be better if it was just a straight up negation effect, where The Persona player can declare that they won&#39;t answer a question.<br /><br />- Those Who Fight Monsters. I like the Team part of this, as I think The Persona should do well in PvP, but I don&#39;t like the imperiling civilians part of this. It&#39;s just a bit too callous, and makes them out as a bully. I think it&#39;d be great if it was more like The Transformed&#39;s moves. <br /><br />- Long Shadow. Very nice! I&#39;m glad you used my suggestion :) However, I don&#39;t like the trigger for it, &quot;When you encounter a prominent location frequented...&quot;. I think it&#39;s too specific for it to show up in play much. <br /><br />- Well-known but Not Well-funded &amp; Twilight Emissary. Hmm :( Isn&#39;t a theme of the playbook that the Hero needs to become the Persona, because the Hero just isn&#39;t enough to do what needs to be done? That they&#39;re setting out on their own and not even trusting their friends and loved ones with their plans? These two moves are specifically about getting help, which I think runs counter to the whole &#39;lone wolf-ing it&#39; aspect of The Persona. What&#39;s more, the former move, I think, focuses too much on the Hero side of things.<br /><br />When we first came together... Could be better. I wish that the Alias was created <b>after</b> the Team came together, so that The Persona has solid reasons to hide it from the Team as well. At the very least, it could be more along the lines of, &quot;We came across my Alias, who I had to temporarily change into...&quot;. Also! Again, telling The Team how they feel is no good. Maybe ask instead, &quot;How did they thrash the team and get away with what they wanted?&quot;<br /><br />Team Moves. I wish the Triumphant Celebration move was less about dreams, and more about willing to do whatever it takes to get things done.<br /><br />Advancement. Should really have at least one or two more &#39;Take another move from your Playbook&#39;."

I&#39;ll respond in kind.<br /><br />- It&#39;s implied your Persona and Alias get different costumes. I can make it more apparent. <br /><br />- I originally had it so you could only use one ability as the Hero and one as the Alias. It was, other than you, panned by everyone I showed as bloated, overworked and not much fun. It was dropped and I certainly see where they were coming from. I think in concept it&#39;s cool but in essence...that&#39;s not what this Playbook is about. It&#39;s just a lot of rolling.<br /><br />- The Darkness Mechanic needs work, frankly. I&#39;ll be doing so and updating once it&#39;s been worked. I have a few ideas of how to do it, but for now...it&#39;s in Alpha on the current sheet.<br /><br />-  Hear you on the moves, I need to make some that are a bit more Hero Specific. Well Known was meant to show this but it missed the mark. It&#39;s the one move no one liked.<br /><br />- Angel/Devil - You&#39;re once again the minority. Everyone else whose given feedback has told me it was the one thing they&#39;d be taking for their game. Regardless of the Playbook. <br /><br />- Disguise - It&#39;s more or less Mary Contrary. That move also allows you to misdirect. Others have said it needs a little work but I don&#39;t feel that Pierce the Mask is a meta-move. It isn&#39;t at the tables I game at and I don&#39;t see why this can&#39;t work when a published Playbook has more or less the same thing.<br /><br />- Those Who Hunt - It&#39;s supposed to be callous. You&#39;re supposed to look bad for doing it. That&#39;s the pay off. You&#39;re not a  good person as the Alias. You&#39;re an anti-hero who puts his goals first and everyone else second. The Transformed and Bull were the two I already looked at, and they can be just as bullying and callous with the GM choosing what all it means when you destroy property. Civilians are going to get in the way. This one just stresses it.<br /><br />- Long Shadow - I&#39;d forgotten who I took it from, others made similar suggestions for such a move, but I think it&#39;s vague enough that when you&#39;re playing in a big city it&#39;ll get play. It&#39;ll need Playtesting to see though.<br /><br />- Twilight and Well Known - It is a theme that you need to take on your Alias but as you&#39;ve said. You want to see moves that lets you do cool stuff you couldn&#39;t do without the other. Twilight and Well Known were attempts at this. I think the former does as good as a job showing this as any. You&#39;ve become, even a little, like the people you fight and thus can reason with them better. Normal heroes can&#39;t do that. You&#39;ve changed the playing field by taking on your Alias even as a hero.<br /><br />Well Known is being scrapped, I just haven&#39;t had time to remove or alter it. I think it&#39;s strange that you feel Well Known focuses too much on the Hero side when almost every other move focuses on the Alias. There&#39;s only two moves, of six, that don&#39;t. I tried very hard to give a balanced move sheet where there were two moves for both, two moves for just the Alias and one move for the Hero with another to flex. I think that&#39;s the right ratio and I think the Hero moves out to show you using your knowledge as you straddle the line to their best use. That way if you only pick the two Hero moves, your Alias still matters. <br /><br />- When the Team - I want to avoid making it too confrontational honestly. While this book is, at some part, confrontational the rule is that you <b>want</b> to be part of the team. Setting it up to where your Alias is just this bad ass that beat the team instead of casting it as something you need to <b>hide</b> I think is better. Because the Alias is something the Team would be angry about. Look at how Red X was handled in Teen Titans. Robin didn&#39;t use it to curbstomp his friends. He only did it when he absolutely had to when they were getting in his way of fighting Slade. The goal as the Persona should be to work with the team to your goals and using the Alias when they&#39;re not good enough. Only your Alias can really do it. <br /><br />Not only that but no Playbook&#39;s backstory comes after the team. The Doomed doesn&#39;t get to be the Doomed after the team came together. The Protege brings their Mentor in from the get go. Etc. The whole idea is you bring your baggage to the Team and the Team is what makes you drop it through play. So making the Alias is rather counter to that. Though if I were going to do it, the When the Team question would be about how your Alias came up. But I won&#39;t do that. The Backstory already asks when and why and it precedes the team questions for a reason.<br /><br />The Team Moves aren&#39;t currently set in stone. They&#39;re typically based on the rest of the feel of the book and while Darkness is in Alpha, the Team Moves are too.<br /><br />You should go back and look over the Advancements. You get one choice of a Playbook Move. Three from other Playbooks. It&#39;s been that way since I dropped the Two Playbook idea. So IDK when you looked or how you missed it but it&#39;s literally at the top of the Advancement section. <br /><br />I hope that answers everything! I had a chuckle seeing you suggest basically counter to everything everyone else suggested be fixed, several of your suggestions were already present in the book itself. I think the changes thus far (barring The Darkness and a few of the moves) have been positive. The person I made the Playbook is so far happy with it though they have echoed the issues with Darkness and those few moves. I won&#39;t be bringing back the Separate Powers thing.<br />"

I agree with choose a Label paragraph but you say: For Alias choose either Danger or Freak and for Hero choose Savior or Superior.<br /><br />In my opinion ALIAS can have Danger or Superior: he&#39;s aggressive toward Crime or capable to stand over the moral or ethical code and for HERO: Savior or Mundane cause it try to be good or try to be discreet (instead or the possible boldness of his darkself). Maybe you can cast out freak &#39;cause his freakness is in the mind-set to use multi-identities not in his mechanical use of playbook.

This is my very first post in this Community so I&#39;m eager to see the discussion from you all.<br /><br />The Masks GM Sheets (available at <a href=\"http://www.magpiegames.com/masks/masks-playbooks-moves/\" class=\"ot-anchor\">http://www.magpiegames.com/masks/masks-playbooks-moves/</a>) suggests a certain order in which you should ask the &quot;When the team first came together...&quot; questions from the various playbooks during character creation.<br /><br />However, there is now twice the amount of playbooks compared to when the GM Sheets were created.

Thank you all, in advance.<br />______________________<br /><i>The fight</i><br /><b>Bull</b>: We defeated a dangerous enemy. Who or what was it?<br /><b>Reformed</b>: We fought a terrible enemy from my old life. Who was it and what did they take from me?<br /><b>Innocent</b>: My future self was involved, and I tried to stop them. It took the rest of the team to help me succeed. How did we stymie my future self‚Äôs plans?<br /><b>Nomad</b>: We had to deal with a danger I‚Äôd met while traveling the farscapes. What was it, and how did we send it away?<br /><b>Newborn</b>: The team discovered you during the incident; thanks to them, you reached the outside world and helped in the fight. Where and how did they find you? Who gave you your first nickname?<br /><b>Nova</b>: We destroyed our surroundings in the fight. Where was it? What did we destroy?<br /><b>Outsider</b>: We didn‚Äôt trust each other at first, but that changed. How? Why?<br /><br /><i>Immediate consequence</i><br /><b>Janus</b>: We saved the life of someone important, either to the city, or to us. Who was it? Why are they important?<br /><b>Delinquent</b>: We totally broke some major rules to win the fight. What rules did we break? Whose rules were they?<br /><b>Joined</b>: The connection between our two halves was threatened by the crisis. How? By what?<br /><b>Doomed</b>: We paid a high cost for victory. What was it?<br /><b>Soldier</b>: Our victory secured an important resource for A.E.G.I.S. What was it?<br /><br /><i>Long term consequence</i><br /><b>Legacy</b>: All things considered, we did well and impressed an established hero. Who was it?<br /><b>Star</b>: We, as a team, attracted the attention of a major media outlet within the city, thanks to our efforts. Who are they? Why do they support us?<br /><b>Scion</b>: Someone important learned about my lineage and condemned us all. Who? Why?<br /><b>Transformed</b>: We drew attention and ire from plenty during the fight. One important person in particular now hates and fears us. Who is it?<br /><br /><i>The Team coming together</i><br /><b>Prot√©g√©</b>: We stuck together after all was said and done. Why? How‚Äôd we keep in contact?<br /><b>Brain</b>: I created something lasting and beneficial for the whole team. What was it?<br /><b>Beacon</b>: We found signs that this incident was just the start of something bigger. What were the signs?<br /><b>Harbinger</b>: We averted a disaster from the future‚Äôs history books. What was the disaster? What effect do we hope it had on the timeline?<br />______________________<br />Edit: My intention of splitting the 20 questions into the 4 categories is that I think it&#39;s good to ask at least one question from each category, even if no playbook from that category is present in the campaign.

There&#39;s a lot I could say about this Playbook. That no one asked for it (except someone did), that it doesn&#39;t need to exist (too late), that it&#39;s totally not what I intended to make (it really...isn&#39;t), that it&#39;s the longest time I&#39;ve spent on a single Playbook (it is by a massive margin and I know we&#39;re not done here), that a Multi-Class Playbook is just not a thing, that a PVP book is absolutely not something Masks needs or the system supports, that I&#39;m running out of things to say,  that you can save money by switching to some insurance company.<br /><br />But really there isn&#39;t that much more to say. The Persona is meant to fill in the role of a hero that needs to take extreme measures to fight the good fight. He&#39;s the ends that the means can&#39;t justify. He&#39;s the shadow of the team, but he&#39;s part of the team all the same. <br /><br />I took out a lot of stuff for this. Really whitteled it down to what it needed to be. I reworked the Token system to the point it went away. I reworked the Darkness mechanic until most of the rolling should be done by roleplaying. Like the game intends. It went from A Doomed+Janus concept to its own thing. The mission you have should be part of the overall story. The bonuses you get should help no matter what Persona you&#39;re wearing. The moves support someone who leans on their hero side, their alias side or tries to balance both. The Relationships are way better now.<br /><br />It&#39;s a new playbook.<br /><br />I am eager to present to you, for the first time and not the first time, The Persona.

I think my two big suggestions are:<br />- vengeance is a tricky motivation for a hero. Masks emphasizes that PCs all start as heroes in some real way, and it&#39;s worth thinking about how to emphasize that<br />- be careful with the timing. A book that definitely expires after a half-dozen sessions feels very different from what we have now; the doomsign mechanic might be a good guide"

I don&#39;t have a Facebook account, so unfortunately I&#39;ll have to give you Feedback over Google Plus :)<br /><br />I like it. The Pillars are a good execution of the Scars concept. The Abilities are great, and I&#39;m especially a fan of the use of adjectives here, making them each feel more impactful and making them each a good fit for the playbook.<br /><br />The Moves could use more attention. Pillars are big, important things! And losing them should do more than just allow you to forego a Condition (Nothing more to lose) or mark Potential (I&#39;m nothing but my Scars). Maybe these should be replaced with Moves that are about defending pillars, gambling/risking them, or rebuilding them?<br /><br />The other Moves are amazing &lt;3"

    "content": "I&#39;d like to share a playbook idea I&#39;ve been mulling over for the last year or so. Maybe there&#39;s already something like it in Masks Unbound or Secrets of AEGIS. Discuss, comment, and help me flesh it out~<br /><br />= THE WOUNDED or THE SCARRED =<br /><br />// Concept<br />Once upon a time, you had everything; family and friends, luxury and wealth, and every other comfort you could name; life was perfect. But one day, tragedy struck, and something was lost. Now you&#39;re willing to sacrifice everything in a unending pursuit for vengeance.<br /><br />// Inspirations<br />Arsenal (Young Justice)<br />Robin (Teen Titans)<br />There are probably some Marvel heroes that fit into this concept as well. I&#39;d appreciate some pointers.<br /><br />// Playbook Feature - Comforts &amp; Scars/Wounds<br />In the playbook is a list of nice things, called Comforts. Such as: a good home, a romantic relationship, parents, hobbies. Even more abstract things, such as: health, wealth, and so on. By crossing these things out, and turning them into Scars, The Scarred can gain new abilities, new moves, and upgrades for their existing moves.<br /><br />For example, The Scarred&#39;s playbook moves would have a basic effect, and this effect would be stronger if they take a Scar to upgrade it. There would also be a list of generic Upgrades that would let them upgrade moves from other playbooks, or even select new abilities and moves.<br /><br />A final, big Scar is &#39;Future&#39;. If this Scar is taken, the current session may likely be The Scarred&#39;s last. They die, are no longer remembered by the world as a hero (or at all), sell their soul, or something equally terrible. Taking this Scar at the very least bars them from ever becoming another playbook, paragoning, or retiring.<br /><br />When and how they take Scars is something I haven&#39;t figured out yet. Perhaps they are forced to take one once per session? Or maybe it&#39;s totally up to them whenever they take a Scar. And if it&#39;s the latter, I wonder what interesting consequences might come with a Playbook that essentially has a self-destruct button.<br /><br />// Team Moves<br />The Scarred&#39;s Team Moves focus around rebuilding and healing. They can choose between a mechanical benefit; clearing Conditions or gaining Potential; or a narrative choice to heal/rebuild one of their Scars. Effectively giving them something back, but at the cost of losing an upgrade.<br /><br />// GM Moves<br />These are mostly focused around pushing and threatening Comforts. For example, pushing a comfort might be reminding The Scarred that they have very supportive and nice parents, and how wonderful and helpful it is to have people like that in their lives. Threatening a comfort might be reminding The Scarred that their parents could someday be in danger because of them, unless they cut ties, or that continuing to have a relationship with them hinders their mission. There may also be a move for tempting The Scarred to heal one of their Scars, effectively pushing them to &#39;undo&#39; their work and backtrack on their mission for vengeance.<br /><br />// In Summary<br />The Scarred can become a very powerful playbook/hero. They&#39;re excellent at what they do, and they could potentially fill any role in the Team. However, those who know them can easily see how all-consuming and self-destructive their mission is. There should be worry, calls for them to give up their life of superheroing or take a vacation from it, but no matter what, that underlying need for vengeance should permeate every aspect of their life, beckoning them to pursue an endless struggle against evil."

    "content": "So my players are gearing up for a massive Gala event that has all the makings of a heist/intrigue Issue. Two of my players have decided that to facilitate this heist they need fake identities. I suggested they play well known heroes and have worked on a Mechanic to make the stakes reasonable and not just about the RP. I&#39;d appreciate some thoughts on this mechanic.<br /><br />Alias: <br /><br />Suspicion: ‚ùë  ‚ùë ‚ùë ‚ùë ‚ùë<br /><br />You have an assumed identity. You must act in a manner which comports with your facade and failure to do so will raise suspicion. Whenever you fail to meet one of the assigned manners of your Alias, mark one on the Suspicion Track. <br /><br />Well Known but not Well Researched: You‚Äôve studied your Alias prior to using them as a disguise. You‚Äôve learned some of their various tics and mannerisms. Pick Two. <br /><br />Physical Ailment (Danger/Superior): Your Alias has suffered from a malady for some time. A debilitating virus, battle wounds from a fight with a rival or simply the march of time. Take -1 to Directly Engage or Assess the Situation while acting under your Alias. You may burn one Potential either on your track or earned in the scene to lower Suspicion while playing up your disability or ailment after a failed roll.<br /><br />Incompatible (Freak): Your powers and the powers of your Alias are wholly distinct from one another. You‚Äôll need some fairly good bluffing to make the square peg fit the round hole. Take -1 to Unleashing your Powers while acting under your Alias. You may burn one Potential either on your track or earned in the scene to lower Suspicion by solving a problem without your abilities. <br /><br />Callous (Savior/Mundane): Your Alias is not known for their good reputation. Perhaps they‚Äôre a villain who wantonly disposes of their minions. Perhaps you‚Äôre a hero that punished harshly and praises rarely. Either way, you‚Äôre not the sort to stand up in defense of anyone or anything but yourself and your cause and everyone knows it. Take either -1 to Defend or Comfort/Support while acting under your Alias. You may burn one Potential either on your track or earned in the scene to lower Suspicion by rejecting or otherwise acting harshly to a teammate or someone you have Influence over outside your Alias.<br /><br />Burned Bridges (Superior): The person you are emulating is either not respected, feared or otherwise an outsider to the wider hero community. Your words carry little weight with your peers. Take -1 to Provoke while acting under your Alias. You may burn one Potential either on your track or earned in the scene to lower Suspicion by further acting in a manner that would make your peers ostracize you.<br /><br />Detached (Mundane): Your Alias, for whatever reason, is well known for their public persona at the expense of their more private reservations and feelings thus making it difficult to relate to others. Take -1 to Pierce the Mask rolls while acting under your Alias. You may burn one Potential either on your track or earned in the scene to lower Suspicion by actively opening up to someone you‚Äôve spurned in the past.<br /><br />Center of Attention: You‚Äôve picked a popular or famous Alias and the world, regardless of why, has expectations and exceeding Influence over you. Take -1 to rejecting the Influence while acting under your Alias. At any time you may declare you are using your status to distract or place yourself at the forefront of the scene. Roll + Suspicion. On a miss, you may lower your Suspicion by 1 to a minimum of 0. On a hit you‚Äôve got their attention, take +1 forward to your next action but increase your Suspicion by 1. On a 10+, you‚Äôve misstepped, your enemies gain an opportunity and increase your Suspicion by 1. You may burn one Potential either on your track or earned in the scene to lower Suspicion by playing to your beloved status when it is least appropriate. <br /><br /><br />In the Moment: Any time, until your cover is blown, you may expend a single Suspicion to use an Adult Move associated with your choices from Well Known but not Well Researched. You may use this once per scene.<br /><br />Facade: Maintaining an Alias is difficult. At the end of the scene or when time passes, roll + Suspicion to see how well you are keeping up your ruse. On a miss, you‚Äôve kept your ruse up and no one seems to suspect a thing. On a hit, you‚Äôve bungled some important detail. What is it? Take an additional -1 to a single Well Known but not Well Researched choices until the end of the following scene. On a 10+, someone knows and they‚Äôre bound to sound the alarm. Indicate one person in the scene and say how they know.<br /><br />If masquerading as an Adult persona, you are considered to have Influence over teenage heroes. If they reject that Influence, instead of removing your or your Aliases Influence over them gain 1 Suspicion instead. Once all five Suspicion points have been marked, your cover is blown. Mark a Condition and prepare for the worst. <br />"

She was the child of adult heroes that had already been introduced in the campaign, and their powerset didn&#39;t match one of those listed for the Legacy. So we took her parents&#39; powers (weather control) and created a track of abilities for them:<br /><br />*Temperature control<br />*Precipitation control<br />*Wind control<br />*Lightning control<br />*Flight<br /><br />This worked well. She picked Temperature control, wind control, and flight. Which are pretty cool on their own! But the lack of lightning and rain, snow, hail etc. also gave the sense she had room to grow into her heroic mantle. It&#39;s cool to break down a classic powerset into a suite from which the Legacy has to choose what they can do already and what they aspire to get to do."

In my next session, the heroes will face off with a villain whose technology is similar to that of Hardware, a Rook-allied adult hero. This is a fact they can exploit in the fiction to overcome the villain. I thought it would be cool if this comes to their attention via a flashback to one of their classes. I thought about adding this to the move as an option as a &quot;flashback&quot; hold type mechanic. But do I trust that someone at the table is going to make that roll and take the option, or do I just add that for free to force the issue?<br /><br /><b>The move</b><br /><br />At the Rook Academy, you are publicly trying to learn, but secretly keeping an eye on the practices of Rook Academy. How does this go? <br /><br />There are many instructors at Rook Academy, but a few stand out. <b>When attending class</b> at Rook Academy, choose one instructor that was particularly influential to you:<br /><b>Shadowblade</b> ‚Äì A black man who appears to only have a black wardrobe, with the ability to conjure weapons out of shadow. Always very serious and dour. Sort of scary.<br /><b>Bastion</b> ‚Äì He looks like a stereotypical eccentric science professor with pale skin and frizzy gray hair except for the chrome boxes protruding from his balding scalp. Has a genius level intellect and psychic powers.<br /><br />If you chose <b>Shadowblade</b>, roll + Superior.<br />If you chose <b>Bastion</b>, roll + Freak.<br /><br />On a 7-9 choose one. On a 10+, choose two:<br />- Gain insight or learn a secret about your instructor. They lose influence over you.<br />- You ingratiate yourself to your instructor. You gain influence over them.<br />- You and another Rook student (choose one or create a new one) form an accord to get by in the class; describe how. You gain influence over them. If you already have influence over them, instead describe how your experience affected you; shift the chosen label up and any other label down.<br /><br />On a miss, you cross your new instructor in a bad way; describe how. Mark a condition, and the GM will shift your labels.<br />"

But Young Justice has non-aging Superboy, and Xmen Evolution has the ancient, ageless Wolverine hanging out and going on missions alongside the kids.

Amethyst in Steven Universe has the physical appearance and personality of a high school age kid despite being hundreds of years old.<br /><br />Some shows have episodes where an older character gets teenified briefly, for an episode or so. Justice League has it for Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, and Green Lantern. Ben 10, Futurama, Sailor Moon - it&#39;s not an uncommon trope. In Jackie Chan Adventures, Uncle gets a de-aging talisman that lets him fight alongside the younger characters for a bit.<br /><br />I&#39;m sorry if it bothers you? It wasn&#39;t my intent."

Oooooh. Okay, see, I didn&#39;t realize where you were going with &#39;creepy&#39;. No, no, I intended this playbook for largely comedic purposes. My group has a lot of silliness between its occasional dark and broody panels, and very little, uh, &#39;romantic&#39; content. In a dozen (6 hour) sessions or so, we&#39;ve had... I think one kiss between teammates? We definitely use the system to be more cartoonish, and less of the overly sexualizing comic book stuff. That&#39;s one reason I didn&#39;t really make the transition from watching superhero cartoons as a kid into comic books. I picked up a Teen Titans and was like &quot;Holy crap, how are wrinkly old men drawing Starfire in this pedo string bikini shit and not creeping themselves out?&quot; And just put the whole thing down. <br /><br />So, at least I understand your concern now. So, no, I did not envision someone using Masks as a statutory rape simulator. Please don&#39;t do that! It&#39;s bad. <br /><br />As for not having any hard examples in the genre, that&#39;s kind of the point. All the big archetypes have playbooks already, or are getting them. I&#39;m trying to explore new real estate. So, I have inspirations, which aren&#39;t 100% the thing. Once we get a chance to playtest, I&#39;ll post about how it goes. We&#39;ll see! It could be a flop. It&#39;s possible! You have to risk that to innovate.<br /><br />I get what you&#39;re saying about being overwritten, though. In Masks, I think a lot of that flavor text would go into, like, a adjoining page of the book. Like, &quot;Here&#39;s the Newborn.&quot;, &quot;Here&#39;s a page talking about the Newborn.&quot; in Halcyon City Herald Collection. Maybe I could offload a lot of that, and add other helpful advice (GM Moves, please don&#39;t use this for rapey purposes, move examples, etc) to a third page."

This playbook represents a teenage superhero who used to be an adult, but was somehow de-agified back into a youthful body and mind. Now, stuck as a kid with all of their adult responsibilities looming on one side, and the respect and stability that comes with it, and the fear, insecurity, freedom, and comfort of childhood on the other, they must come to terms with their own feelings regarding themselves, their past, the future, who they could be, and how their first go-around of life turned out.<br /><br />Mechanically, the Regressed is not pulled toward any one Label. None of their moves involve rolling a particular Label, substituting one Label for another, or shifting a specific Label up or down. But they do have several ways to quickly shift their Labels around to explore themselves and become new things from session to session. Their Extra, Caught In Between, pulls them between sharp outbursts of either radical reinvention or authority and competence.<br /><br />As with the Host, I do have some ongoing Masks games, and would like to eventually use this for actual play! So any critique or suggestions on how to improve are welcome. (The art for the Regressed isn&#39;t done yet, so please excuse the blank space on page 1.)<br />",

I could be wrong, though.<br /><br />I was also inspired by possessed (demonically or otherwise) characters. Dr Fate and Etrigan aren&#39;t perfect examples, but I had them in mind. There&#39;s a character, Rubilax, in the show &#39;Wakfu&#39; that is a sapient, evil dagger which tempts its holder while transforming into a big, badass sword to aid them in battle. When their wielder loses control of their powers in a terrible way, Rubilax possesses them fully, turning into a crazed monster.<br /><br />There&#39;s an arc in the Dresden Files book series where the main character has a coin with the shadow of a fallen angel in it, and it serves as his vizier, confidant, and power booster, constantly tempting him to summon its true self and become a demonic demigod. Throughout the series, you see people that&#39;ve made the same deal with other fallen angels, and they have a &#39;battle form&#39;, where they merge with their fallen angel and become this twisted mutant with a host of terrible powers. <br /><br />The anime, Kill La Kill, has a main character with a set of sapient clothing that drinks her blood and transforms into superpowered battle armor.<br /><br />The &#39;tech&#39; symbiotes I allude to in the playbook were inspired a bit by Doctor Octopus in the Sam Raimi Spiderman movies and the nanoswarm villain in Big Hero Six. They&#39;re not perfect fits, of course. Overall, it&#39;s one of my favorite archetypes, but one there&#39;s sadly under-represented.<br /><br />I think that the list of Hungers could be broadened. Or perhaps, better defined. I certainly don&#39;t think the playbook is perfect yet."

The Legacy&#39;s stuff is mostly directed toward bonuses on the existing plotlines, while the new Reformed character (replacing the Doomed that used to have her as a Nemesis) isn&#39;t so much about plot as forming connections, which is where we are with her right now - smaller character stuff, rather than a grand plot.<br /><br />Only the Nova had (potentially) a new thing to be introduced - the character&#39;s interstellar replacements showing up - and that&#39;s because that plot is due for introduction anyway.<br /><br />So, anyway. A useful thing to keep in mind. Sometimes it&#39;s fun to use Love Letters to introduce totally new stuff - there are good times for that, certainly - but with a bunch of stuff already in play, using them to keep moving stories forward is really useful."

But you rise above it - you know who you are, you know whose opinions you care about. Tell us about someone trying to make an example of you, and how you shut them down.<br />* [Only on a 10+, and only when paired with option one: Also take influence over that person.]<br />* The rumor mill has been churning non-stop about, of all people, Summer and Aria. You caught a whiff of it, and it smelled rotten, but you&#39;re not going White-Knight them - tell us about the opportunity you managed to subtly give the girls to address things on their own. (And did they do so, or didn&#39;t bother?)<br />* GYRO, the science instructor, has been notoriously unpredictable when it comes to metahuman students with a knack for Science. <i>&quot;Sometimes she loves you, sometimes... it&#39;s the other thing.&quot;</i> Did you impress her, surprise her, or frighten her? What happened?<br /><br />On a miss, pick 1, but with everything <i>else</i> going on, and Vector&#39;s revelations about the future, school has been seriously stressing you out - you snapped at Trace during practice, loud and hard, he left before you could figure out how to pull things back, and now half the team is gunning for you to take his place as team captain.

You break through on the whole speed-reading trick, and use the recovered homework time to coordinate a team visit to the hospital. Name someone critical to your plan for helping Dad: they get a +1 on a roll toward that end, based on &quot;the plan,&quot; OR you get a +1 to Provoke your mom into allowing their help (which also has to happen).<br />* So you&#39;ve tangled with your first real speedster. Wow. You&#39;ve been doing a lot of research on both what Vector was able to do with his powers, and what Leo has told you about the speedster&#39;s background. (Or is that foreground? Time travel is confusing.) Take +1 forward on a Vector-related roll.<br />* Uncle Chase taught you his &quot;super-charge&quot; trick, and it. is. awesome. Take +1 on your next Directly Engage or Unleash roll that uses his trick.<br /><br />On a miss, pick 1, but Andi&#39;s seriously starting to wonder how a speedster can be so slow to take a hint. Lose influence with Andi and take Guilty. Time to make with the apologies...<br /><br />High speed high-fives,<br />Editorial<br /><br />----<br /><br />Dear Concord, [the Nova]<br /><br />New schools are hard.

Tell us what you see and take +1 forward when you face them.<br />* You&#39;ve figured out (with help) what you need to do to help out Harry&#39;s dad. Store 2 Burn that can be used only on affecting Silver Streak&#39;s condition.<br /><br />On a miss, pick as though you rolled a 7-9, and your powers have attracted attention at the worst possible time, hopelessly complicating what was already a rotten week. Tell us if this at School, Home, or In the Public Eye, and get ready to Take a Powerful Blow.<br /><br />Hugs,<br />Editorial<br /><br />----<br /><br />Dear Charlotte, [the Outsider]<br /><br />The boys (and girls?) are all back at school, and all the ghosts in the cemetery are calling you &quot;General&quot; and seem to know what happened in the Sepiaverse. Oh, and they&#39;re waiting (or dreading) to find out what you want them to do.<br /><br />Roll +Savior. On a 10+, pick 1.

Poltergeist-like hauntings are up over three hundred percent, the effected area is large, it&#39;s all centered on your cemetery and that high-rise Rook is so interested in, and someone has leaked to the press that&#39;s it&#39;s obviously because of you.<br /><br />TTFN,<br />Editorial<br /><br /><br />----<br /><br />Dear Alycia, [the Reformed]<br /><br />School is torture. Not literally, of course, but... okay, maybe literally.<br /><br />Still, you&#39;re doing your best. You think.<br /><br />Roll +Mundane. On a 10+, pick 2. On a 7-9, pick 1.<br /><br />* You bonded with a team mate over something, very likely at school. Tell us what happened, and with whom. Add +1 team to the pool and ask the team mate if you get Influence (and why or why not).<br />* Special Agent Parker has been marginally more open to your comings and goings. You get two hours &quot;unsupervised&quot; time after school before the AEGIS van shows up to cart you back to the facility. How have you been spending it?<br />* Almost (or entirely) by accident, you&#39;ve made a friend/admirer/worshiper out of someone at Gardner. Who is it, and... what the heck happened?<br /><br />On a miss, pick 1, but an &quot;old friend&quot; comes crashing into your new life with a crisis and a favor to call in.<br /><br />Hugs and kisses,<br />Editorial"

Since this Playbook actively encourages multiple players to have it, it&#39;d be nice if there was some special note about the change in rules and how the GM should handle it (there is also no GM moves, which are very very nice to have).<br /><br />The Ranger lacks a central conflict, like all the other playbooks have, and the decisions that come with it. For example, The Transformed&#39;s conflict is about being seen as a monster, and the decision they face is whether to embrace what they&#39;ve become and the consequences that come with embracing/rejecting it. These conflicts become really clear in other playbook&#39;s Moment of Truth section, which always have a &quot;but...&quot; at the end. This, combined with strange mechanics that don&#39;t follow existing rules, makes The Ranger not really fit into Masks.<br /><br />I&#39;d rather see The Ranger as a teenager with attitude that is a member of a &#39;sentai&#39; team, that they&#39;re now trying to distance themselves from. The poses, mechs, suits, and being a role model is fun and all, and they&#39;re a valued member of that team, but they&#39;re not sure if that&#39;s what they want to be for the rest of their superhero career. The GM Moves would center around the ridiculousness of their sentai team and the quote-unquote threats they deal with. The Masks Team fights real bad guys and does real good, but the beloved Sentai Team spends most of their time with ridiculous poses (that everyone but The Ranger seems to love) and fighting equally silly villains whose crimes can barely even be called crimes (&quot;He ate all the pizza in the mall!&quot;).<br /><br />The Ranger&#39;s features and moves would center around this ridiculousness, and being pulled between the Sentai and Real Hero worlds."

        "content": "Creator here! Having Erik post this because I&#39;m not actually approved to the group yet.<br /><br />First, thank you so much for the detailed feedback! I&#39;m basically thrilled that you read it, and read it closely enough to have a response/critique. That kind of makes my day.<br /><br />Regarding GM moves and rules-- I am not a fan of the one playbook per team rule in Masks, personally, and haven&#39;t enforced in my home game (though we don&#39;t actually have any overlaps right now). Regardless of that, though, the Ranger&#39;s encouragement of multiple players with the same playbook is basically it&#39;s playbook gimmick, much like the doom track, or the Nova&#39;s burn. So yes, rulebreaker! But rulebreaker specifically designed for the story I want to tell. <br /><br />(And I haven&#39;t actually written the GM moves yet, but I&#39;m going to! And include a note about rule breaking in it, thank you for pointing that out.)<br /><br />Speaking of story. I am sold on the story you are talking about telling with a Ranger varient. To the point that my brain is now working on a compendium class for a retired Ranger, or someone who&#39;s had all the god damn color-coded heroing she can take, and is ready to break out.<br /><br />But that isn&#39;t the story I wanted this Ranger to tell. My goal for her was someone who isn&#39;t sure if her powers ARE the Mecha, or if they&#39;re helped BY the Mecha. I tried to write her moment of truth to be the point where she decides if she is her Mecha Form, or if her Mecha Form is just the tool she uses to be awesome. (With the idea being that the choice is--embody your Mecha Suit, and embrace that it IS the hero, or step away from it, be heroic without it, and choose to see it as your tool.) I think some of that might have gotten lost in translation from brain to page though. I might take a look at the wording and see if I can clarify that story arc better.<br /><br />(I thought about doing a different conflict for each Ranger trope. It was too big for me at the moment. Made the project larger than I felt like taking on. I wanna see what you write for them!)<br /><br />While I love the idea of a &#39;retired&#39; or retiring Sentai, who is over all this shit. But that&#39;s sort of the Bronze Age version of what I&#39;m doing here. My Ranger is basically someone with Golden Age sensibilities, even though her powers etc aren&#39;t really. I wrote Original Power Rangers. I feel like your story is the Power Rangers movie reboot.<br /><br />I think I didn&#39;t entirely translate my mental story arc of this character onto the page as well as I&#39;d like, but for the record? In my head, this is the bright, primary color story of a team who is pretty thrilled about being a team, in love with their robots, and mostly just bouncy and optimistic about everything. Except...except what if all they ARE are teenagers in big robots? What if there&#39;s nothing else? What if you take the robot away, and they&#39;re just your regular, everyday citizen of Angel Grove? What do these wacky powers mean if they aren&#39;t in their Mecha Form? <br /><br />And, you know, a hefty dose of really silly genre conventions!<br /><br />Again, I very much appreciate your notes, and will think about updating to make the desired narrative clearer. And maybe write a compendium class for when the Ranger is so over this shit. You know, when they&#39;re OLD. Like maybe 19.<br /><br />(And I didn&#39;t find a blank playbook. I photo manipulated the existing ones, and matched fonts as best I could. Which isn&#39;t great. But I don&#39;t know what darn fonts they use!!)"

        "content": "Hi there,<br /><br />     Thank you for the playbook, It is an interesting concept, and I can see how if the players agree, it is a fine breaking of the &quot;no two players can have the same playbook&quot; rule.  While that rule is in place so that all players can have their own story, I can see how a collective story can work.  It&#39;s like taking the &quot;Joined&quot; character as step further.  I do agree though, the &quot;Moment of Truth&quot; could be tweaked with a &quot;...but&quot; statement to move the story along a new angle.  Maybe something along to do &quot; Do you and the team even need each other anymore?&quot;  which gives space to explore if you really want to stay part of the team, or is time to move on and retire/become a paragon.  or something along those lines.<br /><br />Having said all that I do have a few specific questions:<br /><br />1) The playbook seems to use the words &quot;move(s)&quot; and &quot;power(s)&quot; interchangeably.  Are they interchangeable, or do they mean 2 different things?<br />1b) If they mean 2 different things, which are moves and which are powers?<br /><br />2)  (depending on your answer to questions &quot;1&quot;)  Under the condition &quot;Catastrophic Damage&quot; (CD going forward) it says the &quot;Mecha Form moves&quot; cannot be used.  But in clearing the condition the first option is disable a  &quot;Mecha form power&quot; at a critical moment.  But if you can&#39;t use the moves how will there be a critical moment for that to be disabled?  I just cannot see how that first option works.<br /><br />3)  Me being nitpicky - &quot;Beautiful Like a Rainbow&quot; requires all members of the team to wear different colors NO MATTER WHAT PLAYBOOK.  This seems to unfairly restrict player costume options.   Let&#39;s say there is a blue ranger and the Nova wants to play an elemental control focusing on water, so would like a blue costume.  I guess this is just a player agreement thing, and me being nitpicky.<br /><br />4) &quot;Posed Group Shot&quot; - Says &quot;Everyone involved can shift your labels as desired&quot;.  That seems extremely powerful.  (what is to keep someone from putting everything at +3 or -2?)  Maybe everyone involved may shift one label up and one label down,  OR <br /> at a minimum require that the total at the end is equal to the total at the start.<br /><br /><br />Finally, on a personal note, I love that last &quot;join us&quot; move where you give the character a taste of the Mecha and then the option to become a Ranger absorbing them into the Hive.  I can totally see using this as a &quot;villain&quot; in a game, trying to get the team one by one to give up their team and join the Ranger core.   that is kind of cool<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"

Thank you so much!<br /><br />I comment now!<br /><br /><br />(((1) The playbook seems to use the words &quot;move(s)&quot; and &quot;power(s)&quot; interchangeably.  Are they interchangeable, or do they mean 2 different things?)))<br /><br />This is my failing, and my error. They&#39;re used interchangeably (and incorrectly!) üôÇ<br /><br />I&#39;ve got trouble with keeping names straight in my head. I&#39;m running everything by someone who is better than I at that, but I think he was focusing more on the mechanical effects than the terms I chose. I think I&#39;ll probably go through and unify it to the Masks terminology. Thank you for pointing this out.<br /><br />(((2)  (depending on your answer to questions &quot;1&quot;)  Under the condition &quot;Catastrophic Damage&quot; (CD going forward) it says the &quot;Mecha Form moves&quot; cannot be used.)))<br /><br />This might just be a lack of clarity on my part, but while DAMAGE can be cleared with that move, CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE cannot. So, you can clear the &quot;damaged&quot; condition with the disable a move thing, but CD is a more intense category, and requires maintenance or time or whatever to fix. <br /><br />I need to add a part that explains how to clear CD. I totally overlooked that. Thank you!<br /><br /><br />(((3)  Me being nitpicky - &quot;Beautiful Like a Rainbow&quot; requires all members of the team to wear different colors NO MATTER WHAT PLAYBOOK.  This seems to unfairly restrict player costume options. )))<br /><br />It does! Restrict unfairly I mean. Absolutely and intentionally! It&#39;s mean! But by choice. Because team building hurts! Or something.<br /><br /><br />(((4) &quot;Posed Group Shot&quot; - Says &quot;Everyone involved can shift your labels as desired&quot;.  That seems extremely powerful.  (what is to keep someone from putting everything at +3 or -2?) )))<br /><br />Poor phrasing again on my part! I really will focus on getting my terms more correct moving forward. I meant &quot;shift labels&quot; in the very specific Masks sense (one up, one down). I&#39;m questioning now if &quot;shift labels&quot; is an actual move or if I just made it one in my brain. <br /><br />I was trying to make a move that let you work together, and move your own labels, to better fit the situation at hand.<br /><br />I meant that everyone in the scene can shift one label up, one down, as in an influence move. And that they can only shift their OWN. I should have written it as &quot;On a hit, everyone involved may shift one of their own labels up, and one down.&quot;<br /><br />Will fix!<br /><br /><br />Re: moment of truth phrasing. <br />I like what you added. I&#39;m going to poke at that. In a week or so. I need a break from this particular playbook.<br /><br /><br />Thanks for the positive feedback too! I really like the Pass the Torch move too. It might be my favorite bit. <br /><br />I really appreciate the notes. A lot a lot!"

        "content": "(creator again)<br /><br />I&#39;m curious as to why you feel the one playbook thing is a strength in all situations. I absolutely disagree, and I&#39;m interesting in what you see it as adding to the game.<br /><br />Obviously, it&#39;s all about group dynamics for your personal group, but I LIKE the idea of the dynamics that can happen when the same playbook challenges itself. <br /><br />Just talked to a friend about this, and he pointed out that it&#39;s helpful to have individualized roles so there are clear narratives. That isn&#39;t something I seek out, because writing those narratives myself is my personal in to gaming. So I&#39;m thinking this might just be a case where I don&#39;t likea rule because it doesn&#39;t work for me.<br /><br />So I want to hear why it works for you, because you&#39;re now the second person to mention this.<br /><br />That said, though, for this particular playbook, and the narrative it tells, having others share it is a large part of the story arc and conflict. Am I my team? Is my team me? Are we just robot pilots? How do I stand out from them, and how do I prove that?<br /><br /><br />Regarding the additional condition. I think I got enthusiastic about mechanics, and just thew in the kitchen sink. I will likely revisit this in a couple weeks, after I see it play tested by the group that&#39;s going to try it. Will take this into consideration!<br /><br />Thank you."

I haven&#39;t actually started our campaign, yet, but I&#39;ve started gathering a small collection of villains for use in our first couple sessions. Superfight is an Cards Against Humanity-type game, only instead of filling in the blank with the funniest answer, players have to defeat supervillains with the best custom hero. Below is an example of a villain I made after gathering mostly-random cards from the Superfight decks. Feel free to use her (that is, if you haven&#39;t already done a T-Rex, which it feels like a lot of people like to use haha). I do have a couple more examples if anyone&#39;s interested.<br /><br />Resurrector<br />Modern Generation<br />To make humanity go extinct.<br /><br />A staunch environmentalist, ‚ÄúThe Resurrector‚Äù gave up her legal name, spent all her savings on resurrecting a T-Rex, a Greater White Shark, and a Woolly Mammoth, and now unleashes them on humanity, aiming to kill all the humans so nature can return to its ‚Äúhealthier, more normal‚Äù course. Wanting to participate in humanity‚Äôs destruction without being human herself, The Resurrector uploaded her mind into a set of three helmets, each of which controls an animal. The helmets can be finicky and mentally disorienting, though, so she takes turns focusing on controlling the actions of one animal and amplifying her voice through that one helmet at a time. The animals, when not under her direct control, are easily distracted, and charge at anything that taunts them. The shark has water tanks for its gills and two nimble robotic arm/legs.<br /><br />Moves:<br />-Frighten and endanger innocents with the mindless rage of a hungry beast<br />-Coordinate a surprise attack by using one animal as a loud distraction<br />-Send the woolly mammoth on an unrelenting rampage through the streets<br />-Use the T-Rex‚Äôs jaws to send large and important things flying<br />-Show surprising and dangerous agility as the robotic shark<br /><br />Conditions:<br />Angry<br />Guilty<br />Hopeless<br />Insecure<br />",

    "content": "I have a Doomed in one of my games that asked to have time pass differently in her Sanctuary as one of the downsides. The location is a pocket dimension dream world where she can retreat, so time passes as it does when you dream, sometimes very little time passing, sometimes a great deal more. I decided to make a custom move to figure it out as I love when moves create that little bit of chaos during play that requires me to &quot;take a powerful blow&quot; as GM to figure out how to weave it all together.<br /><br />Here is the current rough draft:<br /><br />Time Elapse<br /><br />When you spend time in Changeling&#39;s Sanctuary, she will roll+Current Doom Track, on a miss no time has passed at all, you arrive where you were in the same moment that you left. On a 7-9, it has been 2d6xCurrent Doom Track minutes since you entered. On a 10+, it has been 2d6xCurrent Doom Track hours since you entered.<br /><br />I decided to have it replicate the Take a Powerful Blow move so it is inverted (high roll = worse outcome) with the current doom track determining what to add to the roll. I wasn&#39;t comfortable assigning arbitrary values to the amount of time that passed though, so I went with random rolls for the time, probably rolled by the person affected, whereas the roll to see where you fall in the time elapse is always rolled by Changeling. As written the smallest amount of elapsed time, if time has elapsed, is 2 minutes, the greatest possible amount of time elapsed is 2 days(!!!).<br />The themes that have come up in the game thus far (just played the first full play session yesterday) have fallen along the lines of ancestry/lineage, the way the public interacts/reacts to young heroes, especially when they screw up in very public ways, and time manipulation (via an artifact that has formed the basis of the first arc thus far).<br /><br />What do folks think? Can anyone think of any improvements?<br /><br />Also, I love this game. Seriously. So freaking fun!"

Sonia is a Bull who ended last session accompanying a young girl (Aislin), someone changed by the same folks who changed Sonia, as the city&#39;s premier science hero tries to remove Aislin&#39;s hi-tech bracelet that those people have used to knock her out or forcibly teleport her.<br /><i>_______________________________________</i><br /><br />Dear Torque,<br /><br />So, you want to capture Quartermaster? Well, sport, you‚Äôve taken the first step: flying the Lever out the window of Crimebusters Visitor Center. But now you‚Äôve got to pick up Quartermaster‚Äôs trail and overtake him, and then overcome the hardened criminal.<br /><br />Since you‚Äôre relying on the Lever, you‚Äôll roll +Superior, that is +1. On a hit, you overtake Quartermaster (and therefore clear Guilty). On a 10+ choose one complication from the list below. On a 7-9, choose two complications.<br /><br />\t‚Ä¢ F.A.T.E. hails you again, demanding you ground your craft and explain your reckless flying to F.A.T.E. air traffic control. You ignore them in order to stay on Quartermaster‚Äôs trail, and F.A.T.E. opens fire with anti-aircraft weapons on the Lever, essentially trying to taze your ship. The Lever takes some damage, and you know that this could cause problems later if you don‚Äôt take some time to see about repairing it.<br /><br />\t‚Ä¢ You catch up to Quartermaster and get in a couple hits, but he tosses down a sound bomb and gets away. However, one weapon you used tagged him with an exotic ‚Äúscent,‚Äù so the Lever could home in on his location if he‚Äôs ever close enough to you again.<br /><br />\t‚Ä¢ Penny Dreadnought also catches up to Quartermaster. He pulls up on his motorized Penny Farthing and launches himself off to grapple with the villain. ‚ÄúGet back, Spaceman!‚Äô Penny Dreadnought yells at you. ‚ÄúThis is a time for fighting man-to-man, not fancy flying!‚Äù His words shift your Danger down and your Freak up.<br /><br />On a miss, you are unable to catch up to Quartermaster before he goes to ground. Darn that stealthy mercenary! You don‚Äôt clear Guilty, and you mark an additional condition of your choice, whatever makes most sense to you based on the scenario.<br /><br />XXOO,<br />Your Gamemaster<br /><br /><i>_____________________</i><br /><br /><br />Dear Sonia,<br /><br />Last we saw, you were accompanying Aislin to Doc Quantum‚Äôs lab, where she and her aides investigated whether they could remove Aislin‚Äôs Forge bracelet. Based on your requests, it seems you would like to have Doc Quantum release Aislin into your custody AND to receive the casing of a Forge bracelet‚Äîjust the metal shell with the electronic guts scooped out.<br /><br />Let‚Äôs see how you do at this. This challenge will revolve around people skills. So roll +Mundane‚Äîthat is, -1.<br /><br />On a 10+, you get your wish. Aislin has clearly bonded with you and asks to go with you. Doc Quantum initially hesitates to release her into your custody, but you let her know you‚Äôre going to rely on your nun friend for help. Doc Quantum is able to take apart the extra bracelet and, at your request, gives you the casing. She holds onto the electronics inside for further study.<br /><br />On a 7-9, choose one of the following modifications to this outcome:<br /><br />\t‚Ä¢ Aislin, as she recovers consciousness, becomes confused and uncommunicative‚Äîperhaps the trauma of what she‚Äôs undergone is coming crashing down on her. She doesn‚Äôt respond positively to you or anyone else around‚Äîwhich means by default she remains with Doc Quantum as Doc Quantum tries to figure out what should be done with her.<br /><br />\t‚Ä¢ Doc Quantum and her assistants can‚Äôt find a safe way to remove Aislin‚Äôs bracelet. The best they can do is clamp a larger bracelet-shaped device around it that should make it impossible for Aislin‚Äôs to receive any outside signals.<br /><br />\t‚Ä¢ Doc Quantum wants to hang onto all the pieces of the Forge bracelet to study it. When you ask for the shell of one, she inquires why you would need that and is unconvinced by your explanation. You leave without a Forge bracelet casing.<br /><br />On a miss, all three of the above are true. Aislin clams up. She remains in Doc Quantum‚Äôs custody for the time being as Doc Quantum works on removing the bracelet, which has proven an extremely tough nut to crack. You‚Äôll have to visit again (perhaps with a certain comfort object?) and take another shot. Mark Angry, as you seethe about how this went down.<br /><br />XXOO,<br />Your Gamemaster"

At the time there was a festival taking place there, so many people were pulled into the sub dimension.  Most were twisted warped &amp; altered by the planeshift.   In a rare instance, Both Mystic and Daemon were surprised, shocked, chagrined by what they in their hubris they had wrought.  They called for a truce between there battles, to try to reverse what had happened.  Unfortunately, they found that the best they could do was turn them all to stone to stop their continuing transformation.   This has left weird statues everywhere on the lightly wooded plain.

Above ground, cattle graze unaware, and crops grow with hardly any traces of toxic waste from experiments seeping out into the soil.<br /><br />Situated underground a couple of miles outside of Halcyon City, this base was once the research facility of a villainous group of anti-mutants who planned to combat the mutant threat to humanity by experimenting on humans to create their own super-powered soldiers under their control. <br /><br />This combination prison/training facility was abandoned when one of the experiments escaped, compromising the location. <br /><br />Features<br />- locks and traps: dozens of individual cells with reinforced doors and walls sit empty. Scratched writing and pictures on the walls of these cells give clues as to the horrors that once happened here. Vents ready to pump toxic knockout gas into any room accessed without authorization. <br />- useful tools: an arsenal of experimental weapons designed to take down powered individuals was left behind when the previous owners abandoned the facility years ago. <br />- a power enhancement system: too big to move quickly, experimental equipment designed to tweak the human genome to bring out powers fills the central laboratory<br /><br />- Difficult to access: Entrances and exits are miles outside of town, via long tunnels concealed around the countryside. Tunnels are sealed with multiple security gates - blast doors. <br />- location known to many: the villains who abandoned this place were never caught. They still know it is here and even if the security is updated by the heroes, will probably have back doors allowing them easy access if they ever want to come back."

        "content": "SKY GUARD ONE<br /><br />Former space station home of the the [globe-spanning uber-powerful adult supers team everyone wants to be a part of when they grow up, except for the ones who very pointedly don&#39;t], it was heavily damaged and abandoned after a battle with [insert very powerful single super-villain, or aggregate powerful team of super-villains] when the team broke up over the death of [beloved hero]. It&#39;s offered to the Masks team by a former member who wants to see it shine again as a beacon.<br /><br />As a base, it&#39;s kind of a dump -- large sections open to space or trashed from the battle, food processors inoperative, strange noises and obscure threats from abandoned tech or space aliens who have found a place to doss down overnight. But, on the other hand, it&#39;s a <i>freaking space station how incredibly cool is that?!?!?!</i><br /><br />Features:<br /><br />1. A Teleportal from Earth. If nobody is on monitor duty, it can be set to trigger with the appropriate encoded radio signal from a selected point in Halcyon. (This verges on &quot;Difficult to Access&quot;)<br /><br />2. Healing Equipment. The sick bay was somewhat damaged by the battle, but there&#39;s at least one Arcturian healing bed still working. Most of the time.<br /><br />3. A Scattering of Souvenir Trophies. The trophy room had old villain weapons, armor, exoskeletons, power bracelets, wands, killbots, flying saucers, etc. While much of the room was damaged during the battle, interesting things can still be found that might be operable with a little work, luck, utterance of codewords, or blood sacrifice.<br /><br />With proper application of abilities and powers, it might be possible to repair aspects of the station, including its computer core (and, perhaps, records), sensor &quot;eye in the sky&quot; systems, shuttlecraft, defenses, weapons arrays, etc.<br /><br />Downsides:<br /><br />1. Easily Damaged. The defensive systems are inoperative, and the place is structurally sketchy.<br /><br />2. Location Known to Many. Both world governments, amateur astronomers, and every super-villain on the planet knows about Sky Guard One and its orbital path. There are apps for that. Some of them might not be happy about the Masks team setting up shop there. Heck, the original owners might not, either."

Art, Music, and Food: Of course, the art is stolen, the music pirated, and the food -- well, depending on whose quarters / supplies you are raiding (Radiomenace, Deadly Jaws, Lady Flora, Hi-Jinx, etc.) the food may be excellent, repulsive, inedible, or actively dangerous.<br /><br />2. An Aide or Assistant: Balthazar is the robotic majordomo of the Fortress, programmed by Professor Omega to serve, obey, and kill. Asking the wrong question might trigger any of these responses. The base itself will build a new Balthazar if the current one has to be disposed of.<br /><br />3. A Powerful Computer: The lair computer is fast, powerful, festooned with blinkenlights and tape drives, and speaks in a very odd, mechanic voice. It contains extensive files on the heroes of Halcyon (and beyond), and keeps track of gold shipments, military missile tests, and sentence count-downs for various super-criminals.<br /><br />DOWNSIDES:<br /><br />1. Location Known to Many: In particular, the former members of the [nasty villain group], their friends, their lenders, AEGIS, the [elite hero group], and anyone else the author wants to have know about it.<br /><br />2. Diffiuclt to Access: Until further work is done, the base remains submerged, and heroes must swim down to it through the gator-infested swamp."

Her voice was damaged when she was younger because her father who is kind of a fixer for villians by the name of the Rumor refused to give some information to a supervillian.  So the villian cut her throat.  So she can&#39;t talk, but she invented a contraption that allows her to speak through it and can even use it to throw her voice to anything with a speaker.   She is presently being used to spy on them for her father.  She is probably interested in one of the other characters.  Problem this kind of sounds like a couple of your other characters... <br />so i have a less thought out character.  A time traveling girl, Maevis who is meeting people in reverse.  (knows them from the future, but this is the first time they have met her) so maybe leaps one of the characters arms when he&#39;s talking with a girlfriend and kisses him.  Mentions things from the future, or sees one of the characters and is surprised and seems sorry for them probably because she saw something bad happen to them.  Think she should be a red head.  Probably also have some whiskey to slip into the punch to add some fun to the night.  Hopefully neither of these are too horrible for your group.  if you worried what happened to Ela is too violent probably could just make a cancer if you want.  Anyway gotta go to work, your game sounds awesome.  love the characters gonna go back and listen to the episodes when i have more time."

        "content": "I&#39;d also change the trigger to &quot;The first time you ingest Mutagen&quot; to avoid creating a loophole where PCs can get unlimited powers from taking the drug over and over. Also, someone who chooses that the powers are temporary knows what will happen next time they take it that way and no need to trigger a move again. <br /><br />What is Mutagen?<br />- Is it a synthetic catalyst of the mutant gene that activates potential you already had?<br />- Is it the ground up pituitary glands of other mutants that cannibalizes their powers? (this would make sense if it gave you different powers each time you took it)<br />- Alien blood?<br /><br />If the effects aren&#39;t permanent, you don&#39;t need to exclude the Nova; and if the potential downsides are bad enough it could be fun to try to tempt her into risking losing control, too. <br /><br />I agree with tossing the Doomed option. Mutagen addiction is its own unique type of Doom that doesn&#39;t necessarily require the Doom track. You can have fun with cutting off their ill-gotten powers with GM moves when dramatically appropriate, and even surprise them with cutting off their regular powers when the Mutagen wears off and the nasty inhibitor additives the dealers cut in to promote addiction kick in."

This could be a pivotal character moment, if you allow it and the character wants it.

The first arc the team will be dealing with (BTW Spoilers if you are a member of the Losers Club) concerns itself with a substance called Mutagen being sold around the city. Mutagen is dangerous but can give people superpowers under the right circumstances.<br /><br />One particular strand of this arc will involve an NPC trying to sell our Beacon some Mutagen to give them real powers. This is the first draft of the custom move for what happens when a PC uses Mutagen. Just wanted to get people&#39;s opinions on it, and see if any more experienced GMs can give advice.<br /><br />&quot;When you Ingest Mutagen. If you are the Nova, your powers overwhelm the Mutagen and nothing happens, mark a condition. Otherwise‚Ä¶<br />Roll +Mundane.<br />On a 10+ choose 2<br />On a 7-9 choose 3<br />-\tYou get new powers. Select 1 power from a playbook not currently in use.

Take the move ‚ÄúBe the monster‚Äù from the Transformed playbook.<br />-\tYou are overwhelmed by the Mutagen. Mark all conditions and become unconscious.<br />-\tYou become doomed. Take Doom from the Doomed playbook. You do not get Doomsigns. Once your Doom Track is full, your doom arrives.<br />On a miss, the Mutagen doesn‚Äôt take hold. How frustrating! Mark a condition.&quot;<br /><br />I&#39;m making them roll Mundane for the check because it&#39;s more dramatic for a character who is perceived to be normal to suddenly get a power boost, Rather than a freaky character to become more freaky. The intention is that if this move ever comes up it is a character changing moment.<br /><br />I included the thing about the Nova because the Nova in our group is already basically God, they don&#39;t really need more powers.<br /><br />I&#39;m unsure about the doomed option. Partially because we have a doomed in the group and I don&#39;t want to rob them of their unique thing, and partially because it&#39;s kind of a &quot;rocks fall you die&quot; option. If anyone can think of a better option please let me know.<br /><br />So yeah, that&#39;s it, let me know what you think. :)"

And the third one might be better as a playbook move you can buy for Legacy than a general move, but if it&#39;s working for you, good for you.<br /><br />The first one, given the mods you made for PBP, is actually a great move that I really like. It&#39;s clever, it&#39;s effective and it gets the job done. Honestly, my only concern would be it upping the speed at which people gain potential, but for a PBP game that&#39;s definitely not an issue either.<br /><br />Neat design! Not for everyone, but I like it."

    "content": "Just wanted to share some of my homebrew moves for my PBP campaign I am on running on the Sufficient Velocity forums, Night City Heights (It takes place in a Gotham Analogue to Halcyon Cities Metropolis), any feedback would be accepted, I haven&#39;t gotten around to the first combat phase yet, so they are untested. This is my first campaign running a Masks RPG, and I&#39;m really liking the system so far!<br /><br />=STAND STRONG WHILE DRAMATICALLY UNDER FIRE=<br />You‚Äôre taking hits! Evasive maneuvers! I will occasionally call on you to act under fire whenever your current action is taking place when you under extreme duress-like a powerful blow, but much less likely to down you. Also a lot more common-even enemies that can&#39;t hurt you normally, can get lucky if there is enough of them.<br /><br />When you are acting under fire, roll + conditions marked, ‚Äì your Danger label. On a 10+, choose one.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ you immediately take a powerful blow!<br />‚Ä¢ two options from the 7-9<br /><br />On a 7-9, choose one.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ you disadvantage your teammates somehow in your panic to avoid injury, perhaps inadvertently-choose a teammate, they gain -1 to their next roll.<br />‚Ä¢ you take the hits, but keep going: Take -3 to your next roll.<br />‚Ä¢ you bear the pain: mark a condition.<br /><br />On a miss, you duck and weave perfectly. Mark potential as normal, and say how you avoided being injured.<br /><br />((Essentially I wanted a less deadly version of &#39;Take a powerful blow&#39;-for when a Hero is more actively avoiding things that can hurt or hinder them, than taking a hit on the chin-like trying to move under a hail of machine gun fire. Honestly, I wasn&#39;t sure as a newbie GM how to make sure my Beacon player got value from his move &#39;Suck it Domitian&#39; without being pounded into a crater every encounter, so I essentially added the effect in the description as an actual move.))<br /><br />=POWERING UP=<br />Sometime including a lot of yelling, floating rocks, and a generous amount of screen time-a character powering up is gathering all their strength for a heroic effort, either through gathering energy or sheer willpower. They are vulnerable during this time however.<br /><br />When you are powering up, roll +Freak. On a hit‚Ä¶<br /><br />‚Ä¢ Your next turns roll for directly engaging will always score an extra success, even if you miss-add this onto any successes you get normally. You are far less likely to sustain damage while trading blows if you are powered up and they are not, though common sense does apply. Collateral damage and unintended effects will be much more dramatic.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ For the next turn only you can choose to use the Adult move ‚Äòwield your powers‚Äô. If you already have this move, add an extra success onto the result of your roll.<br /><br />On a miss, your efforts backfire and you end up worse than before. Indicate in specific detail how many square miles of Night City you have just destroyed.<br /><br />You only power up once a phase, and afterwards, you may be unable to power up until some time has passed or you recharge yourself somehow.<br /><br />((Since I run things in distinct turn phases, I added this. I like the flavor of a distinct risk+reward move that can go very good...or very bad. ))<br /><br /><br />=THE FUTURE IS WORTH THE FIGHT=<br />In a display of super-heroic leadership, you inspire your allies, intimidate your opponents, give solid commands, or otherwise attempt to guide your team to victory with an impassioned speech.<br /><br />When you use this move, roll + Savior. On a hit‚Ä¶<br /><br />‚Ä¢ For that turn, all your allies can choose to use your Savior label to roll for any move in place of whatever they would normally roll. They temporarily ignore all penalties from their conditions.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ On this turn and the next one, you decide on your teams big plan and the goal you wish to achieve-any team spent from the pool for team moves is automatically refunded if the overall action you plan for your team is a success.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ All allies and yourself can choose to clear a single condition.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ For this turn you can take an extra action-you can only choose to use the Adult move ‚ÄòStand up for Something‚Äô. If you already have this move, add an extra success onto the result of your roll.<br /><br />You only get one big speech per phase, and may have to wait some time before you gain the courage to try something like again. Not limited to the leader of the group, but only one sort of this action can take place during a phase. Who wants the spotlight?<br /><br />On a miss, you suffer no other penalty, except looking a little foolish-but maybe your words will still strike hard, despite you not putting it the best way.<br /><br /><br />((The same as the last, I wanted something extra for Savior-it also gives my players incentives for big Heroic speeches!))<br /><br />Does anyone else use homebrew moves in their campaigns?"

A 12 year old versus six mercs inside his school building turned into a Home Alone scenario.<br /><br />Both of those were 7-9 hits, letting the adult shift their labels, which they did in sometimes surprising ways (dad wants the Janus to get some more hand-to-hand training).<br /><br />Then the group of asshole junior supers showed up, and Comet mixed everyone up into two teams for team scenarios. <br /><br />Our Bull was on one team and got a full hit for &quot;making the team look good&quot; during a Supers Prison Break scenario, gaining Influence on everyone on that team (!!!).<br /><br />And our Legacy did a similar support-the-team option for &quot;rescue the people on the crashing plane&quot;, but rolled a 6 (even with a 3 in Savior and a +1 forward - ouch). He opted to Take a Powerful Blow while overextending himself to get the team a win, and had a Legacy move that let him weather the TaPB really nicely, leaving his uncle impressed with how his powers have grown.<br /><br />Then all three teams went out for pizza on Comet&#39;s dime.<br /><br />It was a good time."
      }
    ],
    "content": "<b>Training Session Moves</b><br /><br />Our Legacy is trying to convince his uncle (adult hero &quot;Comet&quot;) to let a fellow group of young heroes (whom his uncle mentors) get out and do some proper caping.<br /><br />Comet agreed... provided the PC&#39;s team meets up with Comet&#39;s team for some training, to both prove to Comet his team is ready... and that the PC&#39;s team isn&#39;t just some lucky fluke.<br /><br />For this, I worked up some custom moves depending on how the individual players approach the scenarios presented by Comet and HCPD Sgt. Amari, plus some moves for when the teams work together.<br /><br />These moves don&#39;t have any context regarding what the scenario actually will be - for that, I built a basic list of possible scenarios I&#39;ll be cribbing from to provide color (assuming we don&#39;t come up with something better in game).<br /><br />In case anyone might make use of them, here are the moves in question and, below that, the list of possible training scenarios.<br /><br />-------<br /><br />When you <b>*play along with Comet&#39;s training scenario*</b>, roll +Superior. On a 10+, you nail it, and Comet acknowledges your readiness; either take Influence over him, remove his Influence over you, or (if neither of those apply) mark Potential. On a 7-9, you succeed, but can&#39;t help but see both Comet&#39;s point with the exercise, and where you could have done better; Comet shifts your labels accordingly. On a miss, Comet&#39;s debrief is <i>rough</i>; mark a Condition, and Comet shifts your labels and gains Influence over you if he did not already have it (if he did already have it, mark a second condition). <br /><br />(Note: label shifting by Comet may inflict an additional Condition.)<br /><br />----<br /><br />When you <b>*go off the script with Comet&#39;s training scenario*</b>, roll +Danger. On a 10+, you succeed at the scenario, at least technically, and - let&#39;s be honest - feel pretty smug about it. Shift your labels, and remove Comet&#39;s influence over you. On a 7-9, you accomplished the primary goal, at the cost of some secondary objective blah blah blah you weren&#39;t really listening (be cool and everyone will think it doesn&#39;t bother you). Mark a condition, OR pick a teammate you (accidentally?) left hanging so you could get the &#39;W&#39; - lose influence over them (or, if you don&#39;t have influence over them, give them a Condition, the GM suggests Angry).<br /><br />On a miss, your gamble does not pay off AT. All. You badly and blatantly overstep some of the guidelines. Comet&#39;s dressing down is harsh, and painfully insightful; Take a Powerful Blow and choose one teammate you left hanging when you made your move; have them shift your labels.<br /><br />(Note: label shifting may inflict an additional Condition.)<br /><br />----<br /><br />When you <b>*play along with Sgt. Amari&#39;s training scenario*</b>, roll +Mundane. On a 10+, you nail it, and Nasir sees you as a hero, even without the powers; either take Influence over him, remove his Influence over you, or (if neither of those apply) mark Potential. On a 7-9, you succeed, but it&#39;s an eye-opening experience, you really need to be ready for anything; Amari shifts your labels during his debrief. On a miss, Nasir&#39;s debrief leaves you questioning how much of your hero status lies with your powers, not you. Take Insecure, and Nasir shifts your labels. If you&#39;re already Insecure, Take a Powerful blow.<br /><br />(Note: label shifting by Comet may inflict an additional Condition.)<br /><br />----<br /><br />When you <b>*team up with the other teen heroes for a training scenario*</b>, make a decision: <i>show them how it&#39;s done</i> or <i>make them look good</i>.<br /><br />If you <b>*show your team how it&#39;s done*</b>, roll +Freak. On a 10+, you absolutely succeed at the scenario, to the point where the whole team looked pretty good, even if they didn&#39;t have to do much. Shift your labels and take influence over one of your temporary team members. On a 7-9, it wasn&#39;t pretty, but it was totally effective. You can&#39;t figure out why some of your team is unhappy. Take influence over one teammate; plus, either a team mate gets influence over you, or you take a condition.<br /><br />On a miss... well, that was embarrassing. You looked like a fool, and if it weren&#39;t for the team&#39;s quick thinking, ti would have been a total fiasco. Comet shifts your labels during the debrief, and the &quot;real&quot; team leader gets influence over you. Take a condition.<br /><br />(Note: label shifting may inflict an additional Condition.)<br /><br /><br />If you <b>*make them look good*</b>, roll +Savior. On a 10+, your team looks like the heroes you know they are, and they see what real support looks like; take influence over everyone on your temporary team. On a 7-9, you had to scramble, but you managed to keep the wheels from coming off and get a win. Tell us which teammate picked up Insecure. Pick another temporary teammate and take influence over them. Take a condition.<br /><br />On a miss... tell us what went wrong. If you totally over-extended yourself to keep the team on-track, take a Powerful Blow. If nothing you did could have saved these [censored] people, everyone on the team takes Insecure (or take another condition if you already have it), and Comet shifts your labels during the painfully detailed debrief.<br /><br />(Note: label shifting may inflict an additional Condition.)<br /><br />----<br /><br />### Some training scenarios, for color:<br />* Anti-supers-trained squad, with macguffin.<br />* Amateurs with lethal weapons, hostages, and a truckload of adrenaline<br />* Halloween Headache - the Haunted Forest gets Real<br />* Bank Robbery Classic<br />* Burning Building (with Badguys, if necessary)<br />* Crashing Airliner (team scenario)<br />* Prison Break! (team scenario)"

I see it as, non-Transformed can look monstrous (just like non-Bulls can be angry and non-Delinquents can be rebellious), so long as looking monstrous (or being angry and rebellious) isn&#39;t the focus of who they are.<br /><br />It&#39;s one of the cool things about the system; the playbooks are there to inspire and shape, not to restrict and call dibs on certain shticks (especially if they aren&#39;t in play, though that&#39;s a separate discussion)."

If you need an example, Captain America&#39;s the big one, but TVTropes has a big section on it under &quot;Fish out of Temporal Water&quot;.<br /><br />What would be a good, catchy name for this playbook? What moves would work for it? Is there anything this type of character would need that I may not be thinking of?<br /><br />(As of right now, the main mechanic is &quot;Curiosities&quot; - a list of modern things that the playbook finds noteworthy - which could equally mean fascinating, terrifying, or a bane to society, depending on the character. How these work mechanically is something I&#39;m still hammering out.) "

Usually you secret identity types lean on the whole &#39;keep my loved ones safe&#39; thing pretty hard.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Not really a concern for me.&quot; Erin half-smiled, staring down at the floor between her feet. &quot;And I don&#39;t see how lying to is supposed to keep anybody safe, anyway.&quot;<br /><br />Gemini leaned forward. &quot;So why the mask? You know, if you don&#39;t mind sharing... Bearing in mind I&#39;ve saved your life twice now, just sayin&#39;.&quot;<br /><br />Erin was quiet for a long moment before looking up. &quot;I&#39;ve done... some pretty bad stuff. To other people. And I didn&#39;t even give it a second thought before, but after that thing with the Medusa...&quot;<br /><br />Her voice trembled for a moment, and her hands tightened into fists in her lap. After a moment, she continued, her voice steady. &quot;After <i>that,</i> I got a taste of what being helpless felt like. So I&#39;m trying to do better. To <i>be</i> better. And if people knew who I was‚Äì&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It would sully your heroic reputation?&quot; Gemini cut in.<br /><br />Erin half-shrugged. &quot;Well, yeah, that too. But the big thing is that if I want to make up for all the stuff I&#39;ve done, I have to do it as <i>me.</i> As Erin, not as The Golem. And if people knew we were the same person, they might think that the stuff I do out here somehow absolves me of all the stuff I did back there. And then, I might start to think that, too.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I just...&quot; She rubbed the back of her neck, looking for the words. &quot;I want this part of my life to be a choice, not a &#39;get out of responsibility free&#39; card. You know?&quot;<br /><br />Gemini stared back at her for a long moment, then leaned back into the couch with a satisfied nod. &quot;Yeah, I think that settles it.&quot;<br /><br />Erin raised an eyebrow. &quot;Settles what?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I was all prepped to talk you into going home. Had this whole speech planned out.&quot; She puffed out her chest and put on a stern voice. &quot;&#39;You really want to keep your loved ones safe, don&#39;t go out and pick fights with supervillains.&#39;&quot;<br /><br />&quot;...And now?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Now,&quot; Gemini smirked, her eyes twinkling. &quot;I can see you&#39;re too broody to go home no matter what anyone tells you. So I&#39;m going to teach you everything I know about this life... and maybe next time you can handle a bush-league bank robbery on your own.&quot;<br /><br />She leaned forward, offering her hand. &quot;Deal?&quot;<br /><br />Erin stared across at her, and after a moment&#39;s hesitation, shook her hand. &quot;Deal.&quot;<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Prepping for <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23NaNoWriMo/posts\">#NaNoWriMo</a>. Don&#39;t know if this scene will play out exactly like this, but I&#39;m trying to get into the characters&#39; heads. I&#39;m going to try and prep instead of pants this year, we&#39;ll see how it goes!<br /><br />I don&#39;t have a title yet, but the story is about a high school bully who gets abducted by a supervillain and ends up with powers as a result. The experience makes her reevaluate and try to redeem herself, and as she&#39;s reforging her identity her freshman superhero efforts also get her involved in an intricate web of villainy.<br /><br />For posterity, she&#39;s based on a Masks character I never got to play: a Janus whose mundane obligations and opportunities were focused on that path of redemption rather than just being a way to complicate her superhero actions. The villain who abducted her turned her to stone, and she was eventually able to turn herself back when her powers manifested; now she can turn to stone and back at will, as well as speak to earth and stone.<br /><br />Gemini is also a character I didn&#39;t get to play much, though she&#39;s a bit older and was in the Valiant system. She&#39;s kind of a mix of Firestorm and Green Lantern; she&#39;s psychically and physiologically bonded with an alien creature of living light and has a variety of light-based powers as a result. She is laid back bordering on lazy, and may or may not be a terrible role model for our young heroine.<br /><br />I&#39;m still cementing the cast, but there may be a few more unplayed and barely-played characters among them. They need a home!"

Everybody except for myself was new to games Powered by the Apocalypse, but they all took to it pretty well once they got over the lack of hard power stats etc.<br /><br />While the players are still kinda fine-tuning their character looks (a Nova named Firefly, a Doomed named Incubus, and a Reformed named Black Lotus), I got plenty of inspiration for antagonists, and started sketching as soon as I got home. I might end up finishing these in color with Adobe Illustrator later, but wanted to share them for now.",

If you can&#39;t find Trade Gothic and you&#39;re looking for something that&#39;s close, Interstate will work.<br /><br />However, it might also be Knockout, probably Knockout No. 69 Full Lightweight. I&#39;ve worked with Daniel Solis (who did Masks&#39; layout) on projects before and know he has the full Knockout typeface. In 69 Full Lightweight, it looks like the M comes to a point the center on the baseline like Interstate&#39;s M, and the counter in the A looks like a match. The K&#39;s bottom diagonal also ends up at the right spot. The only thing I that doesn&#39;t line up are the ends of the S, which I think are parallel to the baseline instead of slanted, like in the logo.<br /><br />But I&#39;m more confident it&#39;s Trade Gothic, based on the ends of the S."

What. Just. Happened?!?<br /><br />That was the craziest interview-turned-super-brawl we&#39;ve seen this year, which is saying something because just the Morning Starr has had like... what is it? FIVE of them?<br /><br />People are going crazy on Twitter. Link is mysterious. Ghost Girl is terrifying. Concord is adorable. Mercury is too hot. Mercury is too slow. It&#39;s stupid.<br /><br />Now, I&#39;ll be the first to admit something is off with what went down. Someone is definitely trying to mess with us, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the Quill Foundation or something.<br /><br />&quot;These are not the evil corporate overlords you&#39;re looking for.&quot;<br /><br />I&#39;m trying not to fangirl here, but the thing is the guys we saw in the interview looked like the real thing; they looked like they were scrambling.<br /><br />Scrambling in a good way, I mean! They didn&#39;t know what was about to happen, they didn&#39;t know what was coming - except for Mercury and Jason Quill, they weren&#39;t even really ready for the interview part, let alone Iconoclast showing up.<br /><br />And as for someone paying Iconoclast to take a dive, come on! Five SECONDS on Google would tell you that is never. going. to happen. She hates every super equally. NO WAY does she fake a fight to make any of them look good.<br /><br />And Troll is too much of an asshole to do anything like that either.<br /><br />This was the real deal.<br /><br />And the best part is, people are either arguing they&#39;re fake or already trying to get them to fit in some pigeonhole: They&#39;re the newest Junior HHS, or the Teen Triumph, or a Regulators reboot.<br /><br />But I don&#39;t think any of them got it right.<br /><br />I think this is something new.<br /><br />Teen Vogue&#39;s cover piece this month was about icons, and looking at what we saw this morning, I keep thinking about that article.<br /><br />&quot;Icons make a space for themselves in a world that tells them that the space doesn&#39;t exist.&quot;<br /><br />That&#39;s the pullquote on the front cover.<br /><br />So if you messaged me on Twitter asking what I thought, that&#39;s it; I don&#39;t think they&#39;re a scam, I don&#39;t think there kiss-ass copies of the Silver Agers, I don&#39;t think there are a bunch of super-powered detention room escapees.<br /><br />Icons.

She is using the Outsider playbook, with a bit of a reskinning on some of the moves.<br /><br /><del>---</del><br /><br />Dear Ghost Girl,<br /><br />It‚Äôs been several weeks since you and those charming boys tangled with the villain known as Hannibal Lectric. You&#39;ve been keeping an eye on them since then (nothing overt - you hardly know them after all), and your increased activity in the busier parts of the city has had unexpected consequences.<br /><br />Roll +Danger. On a 10+, pick 2. On a 7-9, pick 1.<br /><br />* You&#39;ve found that if you stay near a highly public place for too long (a few hours) you can feel a chilling force approaching. You haven&#39;t confronted it (yet), but you did linger once and spotted a strange, thin person from whom the force emanated. They were walking straight toward your hiding spot. Why do you think they were after you?<br /><br />* You&#39;ve accidentally frightened more than a few random people in the city with your comings and goings in more populated areas. One person didn&#39;t run, and didn&#39;t seem at all afraid of you. Who was it? How do they embody this strange new world in which you find yourself? How have you stayed in contact with them?<br /><br />* You had no children of your own when you were alive, but some of your family&#39;s descendants do still live in the city. Who are the few you&#39;ve managed to learn about? Are they doing well or poorly? Have you tried to contact them directly? Why? (If yes, how did it go?)<br /><br />On a miss, pick 1, but your supernatural nature has attracted the attention of several groups of zealots in the city. Some see you as a sign of apocalypse; some as an angel (which may be the same thing, ultimately); some claim you as part of their ancestry, while others level terrible claims of crime against your family. The public eye is upon you, and it is wide with fear.<br /><br />Hugs and kisses,<br />Editorial"

At that meeting, the vigilante hero offered some &#39;off the radar&#39; support for the team, though you haven&#39;t said yes, yet. What&#39;s the offer?<br />* Your family (and by extension the HHL) is asking a LOT of questions about Link - that guy in the cool power suit. What piece of information about Link did you intercept before your family saw it? (You don&#39;t have to detail it, just say what it was about.)<br />* You thought your family made a big deal of your &quot;heroic destiny,&quot; but Adam - Concord - has caused more closed-door meetings in two weeks than the first time Transcendent went evil and took over the moon. What did you say to your parents that actually got them to back off the kid a little bit?<br /><br />On a miss, pick 1, but you totally pulled parent-aggro. Editorial will tell you what they guilted you into doing to make up for your meddling.<br /><br />High-speed hugs and kisses,<br />Editorial"

So a &quot;grown-up supers&quot; game is a much further drift than (for example) &quot;adolescent zombie-hunters&quot; or &quot;adolescent theme-park workers.&quot;<br /><br />You might have an easier time drifting a game about imposing your will on a malleable world (e.g., <i>Dogs in the Vineyard,</i> <i>Sorceror,</i> or <i>Misspent Youth</i>) than drifting <i>Masks.</i>. Or grab a supers game that already highlights themes of family, like <i>With Great Power.</i><br /><br />No disrespect intended to <i>Masks,</i> I just worry that you&#39;re trying to bend it into a shape it will resist."

I&#39;m (currently) thinking the focus of it being for more of a cynical stories of the sort where Superman is beginning to see that people depend on him too much, and how he reacts to that worldview (high Dependant label). Stories where Captain America thinks people are taking the progress that&#39;s been made so far for granted and the world has started to stagnate because of it (Uninterested). Not sure what sort of Playbook those to would fit in right off. So far I do have an example of the mentor archetype (Batman dealing with some of the hard to handle robins), and The God (Dr. Manhattan being/seeing himself as perfect and humanity getting in its own way).<br /><br />The choices you make with rhe moves should allow more freedom to handle how blind your hero is or isn&#39;t to humanity&#39;s capabilities."

A focus more on how you try to change the city and its inhabitants, and how you&#39;ve chosen to interact with them on YOUR terms. It is just in the brainstorming stage, so I&#39;m working on Playbooks and would like your opinion on the ones I&#39;ve thought up  so far:<br />- The Family Man (Handling your obligations, taken to the next level, each choice in the field can positively or negatively effect those you care about. How do you keep at it, knowing that you may be putting them in danger?)<br />- The God (You ARE superior to humanity in nearly every way and every time you&#39;ve tried to fix them, they screw it up. How do you handle being a perfect being in a imperfect world?) <br />- The Bridge (All about keeping up a positive relationship between earth and your home. How do you make each side understand each other?)<br />- The Monster (You can&#39;t go back to thinking you are still human, but you can still keep the damage you cause to a minimum... Right?)<br />- The Comeback (You were forgotten or disgraced, but you are going to show you are still relevant in this city. How will you get back in the spotlight?)<br />- The Mentor (You can mold the next generation if they give you a chance,  but push to hard and or too soft and they will push back. Can you you find the right balancd to teach them right?)<br />- The Activist (You&#39;ve taken up a cause and know it will help the world if others take it up. How do you navigate the press and alter public opinion?)<br />- The Retiree (Something happened to bring you out of retirement, and you aren&#39;t very happy about it. What do you have to do to solve the problem and get back out of the business?)<br /><br />What do you think? Is it a futile attempt to try to shoehorn in a concept? Is this better handled with Masks as is? What playbooks, themes, moves, etc would you like to see represented?"

So I present the Bonded, a Playbook that&#39;s all about that special bond between boy and dog or...boy and killer robot or boy and magical sword. Some direct inspiration, as you can see, were Red from Transistor (and the eponymous Transistor), Hiro and Baymax from Big Hero Six and Dar from The Beast Master.<br /><br />Some moves and bits have come over from the old Joined Beta Playbook but I don&#39;t think anyone can accuse this of being a simple alteration. The Playbook plays differently out of the gate and has all sorts of new and (I hope) interesting gadgets.<br /><br /> <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TkJa54JTERt0G3xDIscGou-cS6H-vpCwTu0U6l4d4F8/edit\" class=\"ot-anchor\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TkJa54JTERt0G3xDIscGou-cS6H-vpCwTu0U6l4d4F8/edit</a>"

I plan on having them argue on-screen over what the name is. They are school-age girls who gained elemental superpowers through an alien drug, and have decided to use their powers as villains for a while, until they get caught. Then they plan to use the exposure and notoriety for fame and fortune in the entertainment industry. Sort of the Halcyon City version of putting out a sex tape to get famous. Be a villain, get caught, sell the rehabilitation/redemption process as a reality show, then release an album.<br /><br />I haven&#39;t decided whether to give them one set of moves or give them individual moves. Deep down, I don&#39;t consider them an important part of the story for the PCs, just a view into the world of modern era heroes and villains while they fret over the very deep hole they&#39;ve dug themselves in with a clandestine government agency."

Figured I&#39;d share.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~<br /><br />All metanomalies are given a two-character alphanumeric signifier, followed by a short descriptor. The first character is a letter which denotes the source of the metanomaly&#39;s power, used to determine on short notice which equipment and techniques are most suited to neutralize the threat. The following list is considered in-progress.<br /><br />A - Arcane. Power is drawn from mystic or otherworldly energies.<br />D - Dimensional. Power is native to another dimension.<br />E - Extraterrestrial. Power is native to another planet in this dimension.<br />M - Mutant. Power stems from a twist in evolution.<br />T - Technology. Power is based in science significantly more advanced than what is commonly available.<br />U: Unknown. Temporary label for new threats that have yet to be categorized.<br />X: Unique. Power stems from a source that does not fit into an existing category, which is not shared by any other metanomaly.<br />Z: Zero. Metanomaly does not have any powers that could be classified as abnormal, but they are in AEGIS databanks for other reasons.<br /><br />The second character is a number which indicates the relative threat level of the metanomaly. The threat level may change over time, as it takes into account both the power and competence of the metanomaly. Past actions or trends of behavior are not taken into account.<br /><br />0: Possesses no noteworthy advantage over unpowered humans.<br />1: Can be considered as dangerous as an armed human. Ordinary law enforcement are considered able and authorized to deal with the threat.<br />2: Beyond street level. Ordinary law enforcement should not approach. Single superheroes and AEGIS teams are considered able to deal with threat.<br />3: Significant threat. Only specialized AEGIS tac-teams and superhero teams should approach.<br />4: Threat to national security. Each known level 4 threat has a multijurisdictional task force headed by AEGIS devoted to monitoring and defending against it. Veteran superhero teams  with special insight are on-call.<br />5: Existential threat. No specific countermeasures exist; in the event of a level 5 threat, every resource AEGIS has access to is brought to bear and we hope that Earth survives.<br /><br />Lastly, a descriptor is appended, specifying the expression of the metanomaly&#39;s power in order to advise which safety precautions should be taken.<br /><br />Examples<br /><b>Sick Burn - M2 Acid Spitter.</b> Modern-age supervillain with a caustic wit who can spit gobs of extremely corrosive acid. Currently incarcerated, awaiting trial.<br /><b>Professor Giant Robot Dinosaur - T3 Roboticist.</b> Silver age supervillain who pilots a heavily armed size-shifting robotic T-Rex. Currently incarcerated, filming new season of show on NPR.<br /><b>Ocelotl - U1 Zoanthrope.</b> Modern hero with the agility and senses of a cat. Current member of New Legends."

What he&#39;s getting that is that, in Halcyon, where everything has happened before and superheroes can be (and frequently are) super-celebrities, The Team should be instantly recognizing anything super-related, and they shouldn&#39;t trigger a move to do so. Because, at that point, you&#39;re just following the fiction and the principles.<br /><br />For example, I&#39;m not big into pop culture and the lives of famous people, but there are still a number of actors, musicians, CEOs, politicians and other influential figures that I&#39;d instantly recognize if I were ever to come face-to-face with them. Sure I might not know their actual names or details about their lives (which is where &quot;Been reading the files&quot; comes in) but I&#39;ll still recognize them.<br /><br />That being said, I like the move because it evokes another principle &quot;Describe like a comic book&quot;, and because I feel like it&#39;s an easy way to get the players to ask questions about the world and those who inhabit it, which they can sometimes be too shy to do. And not just for the players too, I think it could really help the GM in fleshing out the fiction. All in all, definitely not a necessary/must-have custom move, but something that could work really well with the right group :)<br />"

In this way everyone can learn about the basics of what a villain is about (if they are a villain that isn&#39;t acting their very first time) and the lack of a roll makes it easy and fast to use at the table. <br />Also it is not as <i>good</i> as the Read the Files move of the Protege that allows for more insights.

A few things I noticed:<br /><br />I think the wording of &quot; one good turn&quot; is a little wonky,  does it mean you have to be holding two to use it? <br /><br />Also I like &quot;some sacrifice required&quot; but wonder how it fits with defend. To differentiate the two maybe make it so that it can be done post roll but the Normal must respond as if the hit was a 10 plus? They have no powers and snare literally throwing themselves to potential death.  The normal can then choose to give the person they sacrificed for a plus one forward or two options from the defend list? I don&#39;t know, but Ideally like the fiction it could generate. <br /><br />Also I really quite like I know you can do this because I can&#39;t.   Fee like it really fits with this type of character. <br /><br /><br />I think the sponsored needs more work but I also like the concept there. Right now it isn&#39;t as fleshed out as the normal I think. Maybe have more of a commitment thing like the Janus responsibilities they have to roll at the beginning of the session? Also two of the sponsored moves are not complete. I think this one could be very cool<br /><br />"

If you go that route, I would drop the nature theme and instead word the abilities and moves around having powers that relate to their belief, in a Joan of Arc style.

Plus, according to her bio she&#39;s only a few years older than Pharah, who is solidly Bronze. And in images of the Omnic Crisis and from the (cancelled) First Strike graphic novel, it looks like the original team was just Reyes, Morrison, Torbjorn, Reinhardt and Ana. So I&#39;m betting Mercy is Silver, although I could be wrong."

There wasn&#39;t any art or anything.<br /><br />My Janus&#39; father was the first Chroma Spectrum, a sentai hero from the previous generation. He trapped the bad guys and sealed them away, along with his powers. However, after his wife died, he became anxious for his old powers.<br /><br />So &#39;dad&#39; opened the portal he once closed, releasing all kinds of wild energy. It caused various metahumans to be created, including our Transformed. Our GM reworked the setting that this was our Flash Particle Accelerator, and started the currently generation of heroes.<br /><br />However, the power didn&#39;t choose my father-he wasn&#39;t worthy anymore. So my Janus got the power instead, unwillingly becomign the new Chroma Spectrum. Dad went to prison, and my Janus had to look after, not just the city, but his younger brother too.<br /><br />My character gains different power, depending which color he changes to. At the start, he could only do Chroma Red (energy absorption powers) and Chroma Black (Density Control), in addition to standard Sentai enhanced powers.<br /><br />At the end of the first (and only) session, he was exposed to new energy, and gained a new ability, Chroma Purple: [Uncontrolled] Portal Creation. Never got a chance to try it out, but got a lot of potential for confessing my identity to both the Transformed and my younger brother."

I run (ran) a power rangers game using Fate, so everyone else got to be power rangers, while I was the GM. I had fun (being monsters and over the top villains is always fun) but sometimes, you just want to shout &#39;It&#39;s morphing time&#39; you know?<br /><br />But yeah, it was a fun character, something I wish I could go back to. So much to expand on."

Magneto has a +3 Savior label, you know. Freak, Danger, Superior, Mundane... all of these are pretty standard motivations for villains too. It&#39;s just how they react to them.  <br /><br />Think a super-villain teen just shrugs off Freak? No, they go take their freak out on other people! &quot;Call me a freak? Let me show you what a freak I can be!&quot; Look at Zero from Generation Hope. <br /><br />If you play Masks as villain teens, you basically just need to adjust the tone. Certain things become more problematic like figuring out why you stay together, and everyone should be on the same page that you can&#39;t just betray the whole group over and over without consequences, but if you&#39;re playing with people you trust for a good story, I think it&#39;s a pretty simple adjustment.<br />"

I have to disagree with beast boy being legacy. His parents turned him into what he is. As far as I can see he&#39;s not from a long line of superheroes. Unless they refer to the family aspect of the team titans."

You can be a Beacon. Until he gets the adult move about using his power with grace and precision then when he turns into something super effective he&#39;d be unleashing. Becomes a gorilla instead of just a monkey then maybe he doesn&#39;t know his own strength.<br /><br />A beacon, a transformed, and an outsider with exactly the same powers are all very different characters. Their personalities are different. Their problems are different. The playbook moves are focused on that, not what kind of energy blast they can throw. <br /><br />The whole game is about the dramatic character interaction and the teenage characters growing as people, not just getting more powerful. They just happen to also have super powers."

Like other people have said, you can make the heroes&#39; abilities conform to whatever you like. <br /><br />Playbooks are about how the heroes relate to each other and to the world around them. It&#39;s about attitude toward their lot in life. Beast Boy <i>could</i> be a Nova, but he&#39;s not afraid of his powers. He <i>could</i> be a Transformed, but he&#39;s not ashamed of what he&#39;s become or what he looks like. Legacy works well because of the Doom Patrol. Beacon works well because of his overall relationship with the others on the team. <br /><br />The Beacon&#39;s Moment of Truth... Imagine any moment Beast Boy stops joking around and gets serious... he transforms into a T-Rex or a Wooly Mammoth and brings down an entire building, takes down an entire army, in order to save the day. <br /><br />The Beacon&#39;s Team Move... Describes Beast Boy in every single episode of the Teen Titans television show, right?<br /><br />Straight Up Creepin&#39; -- What&#39;s more innocuous than a rat in an old warehouse or a dog in the park or a bird flying over head? That&#39;s how Beast Boy the Beacon scopes out a location.<br /><br />That&#39;s an example of how your can &quot;reskin&quot; moves to fit the powers you have in mind. Does that make sense?<br /><br />"

Now that the game&#39;s out, I should probably knuckle down on some of this stuff. :P<br /><br />For legacy, secret identity and sanctuary, what would you like to see on the sheet to help use them?  They don&#39;t really change during play and they have no unique rollable mechanics, so I guess I&#39;m at a bit of a loss as to what functionality they&#39;d provide on the character sheet."

They wear bright colors and jewelry. Their superhero name is Hurricane.<br /><br />Yuu, nova. He&#39;s a sorcerer with a passion for dragons. She even tried to hatch one, once. That&#39;s when he got that ugly scar on the face. Oh wait, you don&#39;t see it because she hides it with magic all the time. Superhero name: The Marvelous (with the article).<br /><br />The sound of wind over icy shores, outsider. It comes from a icy planet in the solar system. Its body is that of an elongated human, with androginous features. It reads minds, flies, can harvest the power of the sun. It doesn&#39;t have a superhero name.<br /><br />Dani, legacy. Her family is a matriarchal one. Their powers of shadow manipulation are strictly passed to women from mother to daughter. They don&#39;t know why Dani has them too. They&#39;re wary of her. Her sister forces her to wear skirts when training. She doesn&#39;t like skirts very much. Her superhero name is Ombra.<br /><br />Marshal/Marcie, protege. Starlight is one of the most feared and revered heroes in Halcyon city, and also the godfather of MM. He taught them everything to be a hero, even if they lack his powers. He loves them as a son, which sometimes hurts MM. Starlight cannot wrap his head around this pronouns thing, so mostly he call them by their superhero name: Dawn.<br /><br />Victor, janus. By day, brilliant student and athlete. By night, the terror of criminals: Dark Matter, a superheroine who can absorb every kind of energy. But these lives must stay separated: Victor&#39;s parents won&#39;t take kindly that their son wears a skirt to fight thugs.<br /><br />Max, delinquent. Ze is an activist, using hir powers to sabotage whatever ze&#39;s bent on undoing. Given that they can teleport and mess with people&#39;s emotions there have been an awful lot of riots recently. Hir response to &quot;what&#39;s your superhero name&quot; is &quot;fuck you&quot;<br /><br />Frances, doomed. Their power is to transmutate every part of their body into stone or metal. The problem is that their slowly turning completely into a statue. They&#39;re also growing steel horns. It&#39;s not pretty. Their superhero name is Gargoyle<br /><br />Roimata, transformed. She wanted to be a figure skater, before the accident. Now she resembles an ice cleaning machine: big, bulky, mostly steely and plastic with an hint of human flesh here and there. And not feminine at all. She doesn&#39;t want a superhero name, but the media already baptized her as Goshzilla, from an embarassing moment captured in video of her facing another enormous monster and going &quot;Oh Gosh&quot;.<br /><br />Kris, beacon. They told him he could become whatever he wanted, so they became a superhero. They trained hard and hard, and made a costume by themselves: Hunter green, like a true archer. Hm, and another costume, from when she felt more in the mood for more flashing colours. He&#39;s now working on a more techno-inspired costume, with an augmented reality visor. They change names as fast as clothes. Arrow, Queever, The Last Bow, Killer Gal, Killer Boy, Killer, Skiller, Shaft (oh god never again), Captain Wood (aaaaah somehow worse), Fast Shooter (ok now everything is going to sound dirty)."

Some character concepts that resulted are shown below.<br /><br />Alloy (The Bull)<br />Held hostage by terrorist organization The Collective, Miranda and George Shaw use a quantum AI they created to stitch together the disparate neural pathways of their dying children Kevin and Karen.  They bind the new intelligence into an advanced android war machine to escape.  Now the new being Alloy is navigating this new world, exploring their passions and finding their place in it.  All while the Collective still hunts for them, trying to claim their power for its own.<br /><br />Scrimshaw (The Transformed)<br />An accident involving mutagenic chemicals and a crate of smuggled ivory caused Heather Hernandez to transform into a 7-foot tall, literally ivory-skinned behemoth.  Her mutation is ongoing and, without the mystic sigils etched into every inch of her armored flesh, would likely result in her death.<br /><br />Riptide (The Outsider)<br />Atticus is the Crown Prince of the lost continent of Lemuria.  Their civilization has existed deep beneath the ocean waves until recent political upheaval caused the nation to reveal itself to the larger world.  Now Atticus, wearing the traditional uniform of the Lemurian Riptide Brigade, acts as the public face of Lemuria to the surface world.  All while being pressured by his royal family to push their nation‚Äôs own secret agendas.<br /><br />Tempest (The Prot√©g√©)<br />Freddy Fang can manipulate the element of air.  Freddy is terrified his strict and distant father will find out, so he seeks out his hero the Iron Crane.  Freddy begs the Iron Crane to teach him the ways of being a hero.  What Freddy doesn‚Äôt know is the man behind the fearsome iron mask is actually Lee-Ho Fang, Freddy‚Äôs father.  Afraid that his son‚Äôs power and enthusiasm will get him killed, the Iron Crane agrees to train the boy but keeps his own identity a secret from his pupil.<br /><br />Hexbinder (The Nova)<br />Marcel St-Marc is a creole boy from New Orleans whose parents moved across the country to Halcyon City, driven away by grief over the sudden death of their oldest son.  The only thing Marcel has left to remember his home is an old creole charm his brother left for him in his will.  That charm is a bloodline anchor to the mystic realm of the Loa, and Marcel discovers he is the only one from his generation capable of wielding the power it connects him to.<br /><br />Ms. Miracle (The Janus)<br />Amanda Washington is a brilliant student on scholarship to the brightest STEM magnet school in Halcyon City.  In secret, she developed a nanotech material she calls miracle mesh.  Now she escapes from the pressures of her daily life to revel in the power her suit of miracle mesh grants her.  Look out Halcyon City! Ms. Miracle is on patrol.<br />"

This is a revamp of the character I&#39;m playing in a Strands of Fate magical girl themed game.<br /><br />------<br /><br />As VR became more and more well done and released into the public, one experimental system seemed to create a much fuller simulation than any before. It wasn&#39;t until later that it became obvious that the system was creating a bridge to a separate realm of reality, or several related realities, known as the digital worlds. Some of the natives of that world began finding ways to manifest in the physical realm, but there was another instance. Due to the nature of some of the games and simulations these systems were creating, it resulted in certain dalliances that produced individuals that were a cross between the digital and biological worlds.<br /><br />Eva Tarr is one such &quot;digi&quot; born to a biological woman.<br /><br />Mostly she specializes in dealing with mindless digital beasts drawn from the realms that are most like action-games and manifest sometimes in the physical realm now that there are all sorts of bridges open between the two sides.

    "content": "Katja is the fourth of the five characters I made using Masks RPG and several random background generators.<br /><br />Katja is the oldest child of a large Swedish family living in Japan. Eventually she discovered that she and her siblings were adopted, or maybe appropriated is a better word. Her &quot;parents&quot; task was to monitor them growing up and prepare them for the experimentation that would later result in giving Katja her powers. When she was about eighteen, Katja was subjected to something that was a combination of a magical ritual and a scientific experiment. The end result was an ability to transform into a larger, more physically powerful monster-like form with glowing yellow lines along her skin. Her adoptive parents were appalled at the procedure and helped Katja and the other children escape though they died in the attempt.<br /><br />In the two years since then, Katja and her family have been trying to stay under the radar and getting money where they can to live. They have fully naturalized identities within Japan, but are still cautious to avoid official attention because they don&#39;t know who was running the experiment that they were living in. Katja provides most of the money and tends to short herself before any of her brothers and sisters, as a result her human form is scrawny and malnourished. It is likely that her monster form places a heavy strain on the body as well, but since joining the Chimera Sirens, she&#39;s been getting a salary and medical treatment so she is slowly recovering. In the meantime, in her monster form she is still incredibly dangerous.<br /><br />Katja has strong regard for both honor and justice separately. She tends to get rubbed the wrong way by Minako, the Jade Chimera, who she thinks only is concerned with justice as an outgrowth of honor and whom is also a bit officious and bossy for her tastes. Katja has talked to Kyou about training her, however.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://thrythlind.blogspot.jp/2015/11/chimera-sirens-bull-onyx-marble-chimera.html\" class=\"ot-anchor\">http://thrythlind.blogspot.jp/2015/11/chimera-sirens-bull-onyx-marble-chimera.html</a>",

You easily move from identity to identity with less trouble than it takes to breathe. With each shift getting you closer and closer to exactly where you need to be to make sure the day is saved. Unless you reveal yourself it‚Äôll be days before they even suspect an imposter and much more than that before they prove it. However, this day will likely come back to haunt you either directly or through someone you care about.<br />Team Moves:<br />When you share a triumphant celebration with someone do so in a manner appropriate to your current identity. If the other person responds naturally, take Influence over them. If they show they know it‚Äôs an act, add 1 Team to the pool.<br />When you share a vulnerability or weakness with someone reveal something true about yourself. If they believe you, clear a condition. If they think it‚Äôs just another act, mark potential.<br />Potential:<br />Advancement:<br />Take another move from your playbook.<br />Take another move from your playbook<br />Take a move from another playbook.<br />Take a move from another playbook.<br />Add two more personas that you‚Äôre able to fall into without problem.<br />Someone permanently loses influence over you.

Add +1 to a Label.<br />Unlock your moment of truth.<br />¬†<br />Unlock your moment of truth for the second time.<br />Change to another playbook.<br />Take an adult move.<br />Take an adult move.<br />Lock a Label and add +1 to a Label of your choice. The Locked Label can be shifted by Method Acting, but always returns to its locked position afterwards. If a lasting shift occurred due to a miss, some other Label shifts instead as chosen by the GM.<br />Retire from the life or become a paragon of the city.<br /><br />The Chameleon<br /><br />Your ‚Äúreal‚Äù self is nothing to be interested in. Nobody cares the least bit about that person, the least of all you. It‚Äôs best if nobody were to ever meet that person ever again. Not when there are so many other people you could be.

Tends to be close to an anti-hero at times. She is regularly mistaken for a somewhat bishie Caucasian man in this identity.<br />Raleigh Cloud, a young and idealistic magical girl who appears to be much younger than Rani. She appears to be mostly Japanese in this form.<br />Rina Storm, a brash young detective with martial arts and gun play skills who‚Äôs a bit of a loose cannon. Her ethnicity in this identity is muddled because of the number of different actors who played the character she‚Äôs embodying.<br />Rani considers her personal life rather boring and would rather have a more exciting life.<br />She has a least favorite identity to take on: Reign Night. She really dislikes some of her behavior when that identity.<br />Rani‚Äôs dream life is the adventurous one she has.<br />Rani is a good person who wants to help people, even when she embodies a fictional villain her heroic nature shines through‚Ä¶so far.<br />Rani was granted the power to use one branch of story magic, the ability to embody characters herself. Unfortunately, since she was granted the power rather than taught, she tends to have some issues with centering herself and embodying who she wants to embody. The three personas she has were the first three and two of them are characters she actually dislikes (Reign and Rina).<br />For some reason, all of Rani‚Äôs long term personas take on names that begin with the same letter as hers ‚ÄúR‚Äù and have surnames that have something to do with the sky."

If you do so, you also open yourself up to being ridiculed or judged for your unusual mannerisms.<br />Watcher: Experience has taught you how to go unnoticed. As long as you have not already established yourself to be elsewhere, you can spend 1 Team in order to declare you have been shadowing a teammate if they get in any danger and need help. They gain Influence over you due to revealing you were following them. If any secret of theirs was revealed earlier in the scene, you gain Influence over them as well.<br />Herding Tactics: When you successfully engage a threat, you can choose to add 1 to the Team as an option.<br />For the Pack: When you enter battle or danger, you can also take a condition to prevent the removal of 1 Team as if you were the team leader. If you are already the leader you can choose to take a -1 ongoing instead of a condition to prevent the loss of 1 Team.<br />Playing the Feral<br />Lost, abandoned and distant. The Feral has been disconnected from society all their life. They mostly grew up on their own with nobody to teach them anything about the way people interact. They could have been broken entirely, but somehow they&#39;ve managed to keep a core of empathy and a faint desire for social interaction. The story of a feral is the story of someone who wants contact but is fearful of it at the same time because they feel it can be taken away. Once they extend their loyalties they are almost unswervingly devoted but always fearful of being abandoned.<br />In someways the Feral overlaps with the Bull and the Transformed since sometimes a Feral might come from a similar story of deliberate change. However, the focus of the Feral is on that sense and fear of abandonment. Even if they have had connection with animals, the Feral still has an intense desire to be with other people and an equally heavy fear that those people will either leave them or be taken from them. The Transformed and Feral might both have experienced a physical change, but the Transformed was changed but didn&#39;t spend the long period of separation from society that the Feral has. The Bull and the Feral might have experienced a similar deliberate experimentation but the Feral was discarded somewhere after and the Bull continued receiving attention.<br />The Feral has lived all their lives in a situation where the ground might literally fall out from under them and their instincts are primed over and above their emotions. Their Fitting In extra shows the battlefield they have between the still beating desire to be among people and the instincts that a harsh life has taught them. Confusion and frustration mark their interactions with other people constantly. In this manner they have some overlap with the Outsider, but unlike the Outsider, they don&#39;t have a place to go back to where people will accept them.<br />The Feral&#39;s Moment of Truth is about reaching a point where everything makes sense. Where that sense of confusion is gone and a sense of purpose and belonging replaces it. It presents something for the Feral to try to branch off from and grow more comfortable at being around people. If the Feral ever ends up changing playbooks then they&#39;ve escaped their fears of abandonment and moved on toward other issues.<br />Notes on Moves and Extras<br />Primal Empathy and Watcher highlight the both the Feral&#39;s predatory strangeness and their surviving desire to be connected to other people. In one case they are aware of the distress of those around them but the manner in which they express it shows as being a bit odd while on the other hand they appear when needed mostly because they were essentially stalking their friend. In this manner, For the Pack also highlights the extent that the Feral will go to help their chosen pack as even when their instincts are telling them to flee, resulting in a Condition, they will stay firm and show their solidarity.<br />Clever Girl and Herding Tactics highlight the caution of a true predator. Initially a Feral will likely hang back and try to analyze the situation only moving when someone they care about is in imminent danger or if they&#39;ve identified an advantage. They are used to analyzing combat and crisis situations even if more subtle situations elude them. Likewise, a Feral that has literally been raised by wolves or some other sort of hunting animal will be used to acting in a hit and run manner designed to improve the chances of the pack while minimizing the risk to any one individual.<br />Hunter&#39;s Solace represents the existence of a place that the Feral can escape to for a short time when the confusion of dealing with people becomes too much. When they were on their own, they would have established a safe spot or lair of as well and the Solace is not much different. It might be a hidden chamber in the sewers with cache of weapons or an extradimensional realm, but regardless it can act as a place of calm and recovery for them or a place of shelter for them and their friends. Unfortunately, it will generally have its own downsides and dangers which the Feral themselves rarely thinks about.<br />Inspirations<br />River \tTam ‚Äì Firefly/Serenity<br />\t<br />Sousuke \tSagara ‚Äì Full Metal Panic!<br />\t<br />Mowgli \t‚Äì The Jungle Book<br />\t<br />Atalanta \t‚Äì Greek Myth<br />\t<br />San \t‚Äì Princess Mononoke<br />\t<br />Jessica \tDrew (original origin) ‚Äì \tSpider-Woman (Marvel)"

        "content": "You might change &quot;physical intimacy&quot; to just &quot;intimacy&quot;, because it fits better within the genres. As an example, Kylo Ren (legacy) decides to share a moment of intimacy with Rey (Hotshot maybe?), removing his mask and offering insight into who he is. He doesn&#39;t see her as an equal, so he shifts up Consular and shifts down Knight. Narratively, she uses this to discover a secret about Kylo Ren&#39;s true feelings, which he uses to clear an Angry condition.¬†<br /><br />You COULD play this out through rolled moves too, but I think in a general sense intimacy in Star Wars is more about letting down your guard for a moment. When Han and Leia have intimate moments in the original trilogy, it is pretty much always in moments of duress that emphasize their humanity in the face of the chaos around them.¬†"

Recent studies in the setting have discovered that the powers come from a symbiotic virus, referred to as the Apotheosis Virus, which passes from parent to child and even then not with 100% certainty.<br /><br />Magic is a process of opening cracks in the dimensional walls and siphoning power to use. A genetic mutation created the ability and it has since been passed on to the vast majority of the human population. Those with absolutely no magical ability are rare (or else not native to Earth) and have the benefit of not triggering things like magic traps or curses (though they can be harmed or inhibited by the results of a magician twisted space around them directly).¬† At the extreme, the sorcerer can summon a life-form from an alternate dimension and keep reality bent around it so that it can survive on Earth and manipulate things so that the summon performs some task for them. Or perhaps leave and shape alternate realities around them so they can survive in another reality.<br /><br />As for possession, rather than being a case of an external spirit taking control of a person as people used to believe, what really happens is that the person&#39;s soul becomes altered to that of an entity from another dimension. It would be bad enough if only the soul and body were alien too each other, but it is also the world and the mind that compatibility issues resulting in growing mental stress, insanity and instinctual flares of wild magic. There are several families that have acquired a genetic trait which allows their body to tolerate having elements from multiple dimensions, this trait also has the effect of strengthening their ability to perform magic and tread between the planes.<br /><br />Then there are the Brethren who have both the Apotheosis Virus and the ability to tolerate multi-dimensionality. While most Brethren have a human, terrestrial soul from this reality some have foreign souls and their Apotheosis Virus tends to cause their body to develop an approximation of what their soul expects. Eventually, the Brethren become incapable of remaining for extended periods within any particular reality and thus spend most of their existence inbetween realities along with other Brethren from Earth and other realities, occasionally visiting realms perhaps long enough to see that their bloodline continues or some other cause of their interest is forwarded.<br /><br />In the case of the Higa, they&#39;ve been born with the souls of dragons for eons. However, something happened to Kyou&#39;s mother before she and her younger siblings were born and as a result, Kyou and the younger siblings from her branch of the family possess the souls of ningyo, mermaids or sirens. Neither of Kyou&#39;s elder sisters, Hinako and Jun, were happy about this as they possessed certain attitudes regarding the superiority of their family line and the power of the dragons they boasted. For further trouble, when Kyou ended up being full Brethren, Hinako (who lacked the Apotheosis Virus and thus was not Brethren) seemingly grew insane with jealousy and envy. Hinako used magic to cause Jun&#39;s Apotheosis Virus to rage out of control, accelerating the advancement of her body within a reality bubble foreign to Earth. As such, Jun is now essentially a full dragon and has to remain within a lair that Kyou helped craft for her. It is expected that by the time she could acclimate to her new body enough to change its shape or survive on Earth that she&#39;d have become ready to pass on to the realms between reality.<br /><br />Thus it falls to Kyou to act as the family&#39;s agent in the modern age. The problem is that Kyou is not the massively powerful warrior of magic and might that her elder sister Jun wants her to be. She has the soul of a species of enchantresses and tricksters. So she acts as a caster of support magics for her team, creating places of stretched space to contain enemies or diverting light to create invisibility. She rarely directly attacks, much to her sister&#39;s disappointment.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the traitor Higa, Hinako is still out there somewhere, trying to find a way to get the Apotheosis Virus to take root within her so that she can be full Brethren.<br /><br />Stats to current: <a href=\"http://thrythlind.blogspot.jp/2015/12/chimera-sirens-legacy-amber-chimera.html\" class=\"ot-anchor\">http://thrythlind.blogspot.jp/2015/12/chimera-sirens-legacy-amber-chimera.html</a>",

Not hurting anybody or anything. And then some hater with an ironic name decided he was going to paint the lot of us as demon worshipping, inbred psychopaths.....that smell bad! So the navy ups and decides to torpedo our colonies and raid our surface towns and lots of people die. Then there all like, &quot;oh sorry, we thought you were monsters, won&#39;t happen again.&quot; But Mr. Hatercraft decides to make a little money on the side and publish this book and so now everybody and their mother thinks people like me are worshipping some tentacled freak out in the Pacific. I mean, yeah, some of us can do the tentacled thing, but most of us are like me pretty damn human looking, so what the hell? So the for the last eighty fucking years my people have had to rebrand ourselves a whole different name because everybody thinks the old one means &quot;psychotic, inbred, smelly fish-person demon worshipper&quot;.¬† So yeah, that&#39;s why I do this, show that hey, most of us look really normal and hey WE&#39;RE NOT PSYCHOPATHS.

I mean when I was a kid, all I would do is decide that maybe my friend looked better with blue-hair and it was done. Or I&#39;d draw squiggles in the air nobody could see. Or maybe make up my own cartoons to watch...stuff that most people would take for just a kid with imagination. And then I started doing things like editing out walls, or making the room seem brighter or darker, or I&#39;d mark my trail behind me so I didn&#39;t get lost. When I started gaming and dealing with the PC...well, I just started blowing up with applications.¬† Like I can designate this section of my vision here to rotate its POV one-hundred eighty degrees, shift its origin a little back so I&#39;m not in the way and now I can see behind me. Or I can rotate my vision so that its sitting behind someone else and I can see the cards they&#39;re holding (but that&#39;s cheating, don&#39;t do that.) Or I can mark that guy over there who&#39;s trying to sneak up behind me so that he&#39;s glowing like the Fourth of July no matter where he goes. Or copy down whatever I hear someone saying as they say it (but I get whatever I mishear, bleh...glitches). I&#39;ve got this list of folders over here that&#39;s a bunch of class lectures and stuff that I can pull up and see whenever...I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s cheating on tests, but maybe.¬† Can&#39;t do anything about what other people see, unless they get into my head, then I can mess with them...and I can usually tell when other people are messing with what I&#39;m seeing. Some guy figured it out and called it &quot;self-hallucination&quot; but yeah, that&#39;s why I can watch a movie from five miles away (now if only I could hear it too). Oh look, smoke bomb, gotta edit that out. (Why the name....because you think I&#39;m actually going to give someone a clue how I do stuff?)<br /><br />(Self-Hallucination is one of the powers I made for Divine Blood RPG and one of the characters I have planned to come in later books has it....don&#39;t ask me to figure out how it works...there has to be some sort of fundamental unconscious knowledge of the universe going on for this to work)<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Greyskin, aka Megumi Morisato, The Transformed.<br />Female, Unidentifiable ethnicity, grey and scarred skin; burned out and dead eyes; Concealing costume; Clawed hands<br />Powers: Phasing and Supernatural Senses<br />Freak +3, Danger +1, Savior +1, Superior -1, Mundane -1<br />I am not my Body, Not Human Enough, Unstoppable<br /><br />I always knew I was going to get powers. It&#39;s the alien in me, see, we&#39;ve been mixed since the late 1800s and the aliens activate something in the human genome that makes us super.¬† So I always knew I&#39;d go super....but most of us stay looking normal. It wasn&#39;t really my powers that changed me, see, it was my powers activating that let me survive. There was a fight see, I think it was the Spears of Achilles (you know those super-mercs) and the Aesir (I was in Norway with my brother) and there was some toxic waste...and it ended up on me. Now, my powers activated so I sort of phased out of this reality in time to live but not in time to prevent being burned to hell. I&#39;m sort of healing...but I&#39;m not healing back human...or either of the aliens I&#39;m descended from. I got these...claws that aren&#39;t really useful for anything like delicate stuff. And...I got this mental block on my phasing, it takes a lot of focus, and sometimes I freak out and get stuck in things...but I can cancel out mass and sort of half-phase so I sort of act like one of those super-strong bricks. And...I don&#39;t really see anymore...well I do...but I see...umm dimensional bonds between people and objects and such. I can do most of the stuff you can with normal sight like read and such, but try to explain colors to people and sometimes shapes...and uh....yeah, I mean I don&#39;t see colors anymore blue ink has different sorts of anchors than black ink...I think it was black and blue anyway...but yeah...there&#39;s that. But still, I was meant to be super from the beginning...so...so I can figure out the hideous burns and monster thing...and I won&#39;t get stuck in another wall after a panic attack...I hope.<br /><br />(Greyskin was a Champions character of mine with superstrength and resistances based on interweaving through various other realities¬† <a href=\"http://fav.me/d5e41br\" class=\"ot-anchor\">http://fav.me/d5e41br</a> ... <a href=\"http://fav.me/d9dyoiy\" class=\"ot-anchor\">http://fav.me/d9dyoiy</a>)<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Medusa, aka Terra Black the Nova<br />Female, Mixed Ethnicity, Common Clothing, School Uniform<br />Powers: Sorcery (Transformation, Rebirth, Dimensional Barriers)<br />Freak +2, Danger +1, Savior +0, Superior +0, Mundane +0<br />Burn: Elemental Awareness, Shielding, Worship, Boost<br /><br />So, like, it started with that, you know amulet thing.

Yay, I get to be a, you know goddess but won&#39;t get to enjoy immortality....and none of my clothes fit any more because apparently Medusa comes with ridiculous comic book build...Yay.<br /><br />(Thought about Doomed, but doesn&#39;t really fit...she&#39;s not really doomed, her position just comes with lots of enemies<br /><br />Extended origin: <a href=\"http://fav.me/dcqw6o\" class=\"ot-anchor\">http://fav.me/dcqw6o</a>)<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Tender Bar, the Bull<br />Tall, Slender, Female, Middle-Eastern, Ragged Clothing, No Costume<br />Pure and simple rage.<br />Freak +1, Danger +3, Savior -1, Superior +1, Mundane -1<br />The Bull&#39;s Heart, Thick and Thin-Skinned, Punch Everyone<br /><br />Don&#39;t ask me how I can do what I can do.

How do I know she&#39;s Japanese? Well let&#39;s look at the footage. She goes around in &quot;wearing&quot; what looks like telekinetic samurai armor topped off with an actual kabuto and menpo. She speaks perfect accentless Japanese. If she&#39;s not Japanese then she&#39;s one hell of a poser. Me, I took the oath a month ago. And I&#39;m officially in the system as Jean, J-E-A-N, Hannah. I&#39;m American now and I&#39;m too busy getting into law school to care about some fool stuck in the past and banging heads in a romantic notion that that will solve things.<br /><br />Konnichi-wa. Hana Jin desu. Hello. Don&#39;t worry about Jean. If she really felt the way she claims I wouldn&#39;t exist the way I do. See. She still believes in justice, love, all that stuff. In proof of that. She just doesn&#39;t believe in herself. She needs all that to be &quot;someone else&quot;. Eventually she&#39;ll accept herself and we&#39;ll be whole again. Until then I&#39;ll be around to let her do what she thinks she can&#39;t do. <br /><br />Note. Jin and Jean have different colored eyes. Something about the shift causes the melanin in her eyes to change. Both eye colors are exceeding rare but do occur in real life.  Jin has gold eyes. Jean has red eyes. Before the first time Jean&#39;s mind split she had brown eyes. To add to the difference, Jin uses the same psychokinetic powers that manifest her armor to make it seem like her hair is glowing gold. At least when helping. Jin occasionally takes over outside of heroing.<br /><br />Jean is capable of using telepathy without triggering Jin. But it is difficult. She doesn&#39;t like to do it and it mostly happens on accident. Her other powers only manifest while Jin is active.  <br /><br />Jin keeps Jeans secrets.  Unless Jin has already revealed a secret to someone she won&#39;t break that trust unless there&#39;s an absolute need. "

        "content": "It may be the art chosen, but I tend to equate the Bull with the person of vast physical power.  Wolverine certainly fits, but not necessarily. <br /><br />One particular character of mine that would heavily fit the Bull is Naiki Semezou from some of my stories.  She&#39;s mostly a happy, go lucky super strong person who gets a kick from getting into difficult fights.  She&#39;s prone to leaping before thinking and causes a lot of damage from being a well-meaning but reckless ball of energy. <br /><br />When I think of Feral I think of a character that tends to be animalistically cautious and suspicious of things around them. Someone not used to having ever had a safe place.  Having triggers that turn them into engines of destruction certainly, but usually when cornered.  Also, not necessarily physical power sets.  One particular character played by a friend of mine in a WoD game was a teen mage by the name of Ferral who thought of the spheres as her friends, gave them names like The Traveller (Space..may be wrong) and referred to casting spells as playing with them. She lived in a burned out husk of a building and used magic to open up small worm holes so that she could use her knife to slash things from a distance usually birds. She thought birds were evil and use another ritual to swallow their souls to gain Quintessence and prevent them from coming back to life. (Bird shifters killed her parents).  Everything about her personality was wild animal but her power set was Mind, Space and Prime spheres mostly. <br /><br />Passion and emotion are not always present in someone feral either. Very often they will be cold or emotionless in situations the average person feels warrants heavy emotion. So the Outsider sort of fits to represent that mismatch.  But again the mismatch of character to society is not necessarily expressed as being feral.  It&#39;s one of several options to portray the Outsider just like its one of several ways to portray the Transformed or Bull.  <br /><br />Likewise Sousuke Sagara clearly has sophisticated skills being able to pilot (and program) mecha, use complex tactics, analyze battles and so on. But he is still feral in that his attentions and attitudes are primed for seeking out danger to himself or others.  His reactions to daily situations range from disturbingly stone faced to violent overreaction and people not knowing where he gets it from wouldn&#39;t be able to understand why.  He could be done as a Bull or an Outsider (despite being an unpowered earth-born human) depending on whether he focused on his destructive potential or his mismatch with society."

But coincidentally I did just finish a draft of a Playbook. <br /><br />General stuff:<br /><br />Abilities: choose two tags to describe what sort of predator you are: primal, ambush, adaptive, trap-making, eldritch, relentless, stalking, quick, powerful, skillful. <br /><br />Environment: choose one to describe your experience: child soldier, supernatural incident, lost in the wild, unethical experimentation/lab rat, cracks of the city, amnesia, Trapped in Mindscape, Future Apocalypse, Mental trauma. (Thinking of just leaving this to one of the backstory questions.  There are so many interpretations)<br /><br />Labels: +1 Freak, +2 Danger, +1 Savior, -1 Superior, -1 Mundane<br /><br />When your team first came together it took some effort to act in sync. What did it take for you to cooperate smoothly the first time?<br /><br />You think <i>_______</i> is either in danger or a danger. You haven&#39;t figured out which. <br /><br /><i>______________</i> often corrects you on how to behave around people. <br /><br />Choose one:<br /><br />You behave in a curious and outgoing way that conceals your predatory nature. Give influence to two team members. <br /><br />You behave in a stand-offish or aggressive way that conceals your gentler nature. Give influence to nobody. <br /><br />Fitting in: choose three problems you have fitting in with people: language issues, emotional mismatch, paranoia, animalistic, tech confusion, blind to social cues, overprotective, no culture. <br /><br />If a non-combat situation occurs that hits one of these issues roll +Danger. <br /><br />On a 10+ choose 1: you make huge scene and embarrass or frighten a large number of people or someone very important.  Give this group or person Influence; you want to leave the situation entirely either leave physically or shut down entirely for the duration of the scene; two options from 7-9 list. <br /><br />On 7-9 choose 1: you attract ridicule or anger from someone.  Give them Influence; you are put off balance by the situation. Mark a condition; you offend someone you thought understood you. Lose influence over them. <br /><br />On a miss you handle the situation with minimal problems. Mark a potential and explain how you get past the issue. <br /><br />Choose three moves:<br /><br />Hunter&#39;s Solace: you have access to a training ground, patch of wild, pocket dimension or other place where you can go and be yourself with no problem. Choose two positive aspects and two negative. <br /><br />Positive: secure, easy access, calming beauty, vent for frustrations, friendly residents, useful resources<br /><br />Negative: no security, difficult to access, difficult to leave, lose track of time, dangerous secrets, feeds your darker nature<br /><br />Clever Girl/Boy: In dangerous situations you can roll +Danger to Assess the situation instead of +Superior<br /><br />Primal Empathy: you have an instinct for when someone in your circle is out of sorts. If you have time to show a teammate you care in your own weird way, you can spend 1 Team to clear 1 condition from them. <br /><br />Watcher: as long as you have not been established to be somewhere else at the time, you can spend 1 Team when a team member is in danger to say that you were following them.  Give them influence for following them.  If any personal secrets were revealed before the danger you gain influence over them. <br /><br />Herding Tactics: when you successfully engage a threat you can choose to add 1 to Team as an option. <br /><br />For the Pack: at the start of a battle you can suffer 1 condition to prevent the removal of 1Team as if you were the leader. If you were already the leader you can choose a -1 ongoing for the scene rather than take a condition to prevent the removal of 1 Team. <br /><br />Advances<br />Feral move<br />Feral move<br />Other Playbook <br />Other Playbook<br />Permanently lose influence +1 label<br />Rearrange labels +1 label<br />Unlock moment of truth<br />Remove a fitting in problem<br />-----<br />Create second character<br />Unlock moment of truth<br />Change Playbooks<br />Adult move<br />Adult move<br />Lock label. +1 label<br />Retire/become paragon<br /><br />Moment of truth.  (Summary - my laptop just went to sleep and I&#39;m on the phone). Your instincts overlap exactly with the situation. You know exactly what needs to be done and can solve a problem without hesitation. If only the actions involved were always an appropriate solution. <br /><br />Team move. <br /><br />Celebration - let your emotions out in some primal way. If the other person rolls with it clear a condition. If they react in confusion or otherwise poorly have them choose Danger or Freak that label goes up and another label goes down. <br /><br />Vulnerability. Show submission somehow. If the other person treats you as an equal, mark potential. If they treat you like a subordinate clear a condition.  Either way add 1 Team."

Just a quick description of the Organization&#39;s overall juristiction.<br /><br />Under Powers, I combined the Super-Toughness and Armor options (because really they&#39;re the same thing, just skinned differently) and upped the power selections to 8 by adding Force Field Projection, Ancient Magics, and Technopathy. I know those are from other playbooks, but I think they make sense here based on the inspirational material."

The themes are a sudden weakness from atrophy and survivor&#39;s guilt from being the one in a million that gets a second chance at being a superhero.¬†The Remade is a strong hero that doesn&#39;t realize it, possibly hit harder by conditions that anyone else.

I decided to bother some ideas from Nathan D. Poeletta&#39;s World Wide Wrestling to add a new dimension to the game.¬†<br /><br />I tried my best to make the playset play back into the concept of finding yourself by trying to establish that the corporation you work for takes away your identity (your own hero logo) for their own and, on top of the other alterations, a custom, adult move allows you to take your logo back.¬†<br /><br />It definitely isn&#39;t perfect, or even good, ¬†and any feedback is appreciated.¬†<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/yemsqesi33v7c4d/Corporate%20Run%20World.pdf?dl=0\" class=\"ot-anchor\">https://www.dropbox.com/s/yemsqesi33v7c4d/Corporate%20Run%20World.pdf?dl=0</a>",

The idea (after we get the team meets prologue out of the way) is that single handedly they might get caught, they might disappoint their villain parents, they might be stupid. Together they learn and can stand up against the celebrated goody two shoes when sometimes that is not how heroism works.<br /><br />Basically, I think a good dash of anti-hero and neutrality makes villains work, not playing those that JUST want to see the world burn.<br /><br />I&#39;m also trying out a new &quot;Villain Team Mechanic&quot; where things like distracting a hero by threatening an NPC or monologuing your plot to a hero can restore team pool."

I&#39;m finding a mix of &quot;I didn&#39;t explain what I meant clearly&quot; crossed with &quot;I didn&#39;t think of that, I&#39;m going to change that in the next version&quot;.<br />Thank you for taking the time to point this stuff out, I really appreciate it.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think I mentioned before, but the thing I love most about Masks, is the way each playbook isn&#39;t <b>about</b> your powers. It doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re strong, or fast, or weird, or crafty, it&#39;s about how you handle yourself handling your powers, what kind of a hero you are, etc.<br /><br />So in that sense, powers aren&#39;t important in the slightest to who and what your character is.<br /><br />In another sense though, powers are a critical fictional detail, because in every hero story, powers go a long way to defining how heroes interact with their world and others in it. The only real difference between Conan the Barbarian and Luke Skywalker are using the Force and the Lightsaber; important fictional elements even if the overall narrative impact is minimal. Plus, defining your hero&#39;s abilities is also a ton of fun!<br /><br />My intention was, and still is, to serve both ends in removing the limited choices without altering any of the &quot;core&quot; important parts of Masks (the playbook themes, character interaction, character growth).<br /><br /><br /><b>Moving On</b><br />I&#39;m going to switch up the difficulty mechanic entirely, but for the sake of clarity and discussion I&#39;ll explain more fully what I originally meant.<br /><br />Each difficulty was supposed to work as a broad theme similar to what Jared said,<br />&quot;With those two powers he can do anything that would fall within their narrative purviews.&quot;<br />This was my intention the whole time, I just communicated that badly in this draft.<br /><br /><b>A theoretical Bull might have looked like this:</b><br />Impossible: Time Manipulation<br />Borderline: Teleportation<br />Simple: Density Control<br />Simple: Gravity Manipulation<br /><br /><b>Impossible powers and the Moment of Truth</b><br />I didn&#39;t intend for your Moment of Truth to specifically involve your Impossible power (though you certainly could, and per the MoT itself, you would take no conditions if you did use it there), only to serve as a measure of your power instead of saying &quot;at level X you gain a new power&quot;.<br />Reaching your MoT means you have this power now, it&#39;s only when you actually use that power in play that you would take a condition representing you &quot;hurting yourself&quot; with the strain.<br /><br />But that&#39;s all past tense now :)<br /><br /><b>POWERS version 2</b><br />I&#39;m thinking I&#39;ll simply encourage creative power description more clearly. I&#39;ll make difficulty an element that the player can decide to excercise if they want or the situation calls for.<br /><br />Powers/Abilities: This section will just be a blank space to &#39;write your own&#39; accompanied by flavor text to help keep a player on theme, (I can pretty much use the existing bits for each playbook before the difficulty lists for this part.)<br /><br />Difficulties (no more lists, for anything)<br />Simple:<br />Essentially the standard way powers already work with regard to triggering moves and the like.<br /><br />Borderline:<br />Spend 1 Team to roll with Willpower (3d6, take 2 highest).<br />intended to help in a pinch, but shouldn&#39;t destabilize the game (especially useful if you just got your labels shifted in the middle of a fight, but you refuse to give up.)<br />There&#39;s no extra bad outcome if this results in a 6-, you already had to spend Team (a limited resource) to do this, so no sense in adding insult to injury here.<br /><br />Impossible:<br />When you absolutely, positively, MUST succeed, no matter the cost to yourself, you may take the 10+ result without needing to roll, but take a condition right now to do it.<br /><br /><br />And I&#39;ll be changing up just about everything else in this doc for v2.<br />- Some default moves will have alternates (like Doomsigns), though I need to go back and rethink that one quite a bit.<br />- The protege is still going to have the Shared, You, Mentor split, but there will just be blank space for writing powers instead of the current list.<br />- I&#39;ll keep Push around (maybe under a different name), and rework it to fit the new direction. I like the idea of discovering new powers."

This is where that part about &quot;the focus should be on the playbook, the powers are set dressing&quot; comes in. They are important set dressing in my opinion, but still just set dressing. In theory you could have an entire team with &quot;identical&quot; powers who are still unique because their playbooks encourage focusing on different aspects of your character than your powers.<br /><br /><br />As for those powers needing to be connected to each other, I disagree. That is 100% in the fiction. <br />Taken at face value, many popular heroes&#39; powers are similarly disjointed.<br />Batman&#39;s superpowers are ninjutsu and money.<br />Wolverine&#39;s superpowers are regeneration, sharp senses and a metal skeleton with claws.<br />It&#39;s all about how the player chooses to tie it all together that makes it coherent.<br /><br />If I were to play that theoretical bull character right now, I&#39;d tie it all together this way:<br /><br />&quot;A young intern is caught in a disastrous accident at Halcyon University&#39;s dark matter research lab.<br /><br />He awakens from his coma to find himself suffused with dark matter, as he tries to learn more about his physics defying powers, a mysterious benefactor leaves behind clues that his &quot;accident&quot; may not have been as accidental as everyone thinks. (who made you?)<br /><br />Now he&#39;ll stop at nothing to find the people responsible (ready to rumble) for making him into...<br /><br /><b>Einstein Rosen-bridge, the relative man!</b>&quot;"

Instead of maybe getting a condition (chosen by the GM) OR having the effect be unstable, dangerous, or temporary.<br />You are choosing your own condition to ensure that your power works exactly as you need.<br />Also, your powers might not even trigger the Unleash move, it might trigger Directly-Engage, or Provoke, or Assess, and so doing the impossible is specifically taking control of your narrative (not full control, that&#39;s what a MoT is for)¬† via explicitly taking the 10+ option with your power at the cost of taking a specific consequence."

Arguably putting you worse off than the other heroes who are at least teens."

That is a good description of what this kind of Mask character would be like. Hell, it also kind of describes my life right now since I&#39;ve gone back for grad school and, boy, does it feel weird being this old in college.<br /><br />Anyway, I got some feedback last night from IRC and some other places that I decided to incorporation into a V2 of it.<br /><br />Here it is:¬†<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/b0u1pqhzzglt2wg/The%20Kid%20v2.pdf?dl=0\" class=\"ot-anchor\">https://www.dropbox.com/s/b0u1pqhzzglt2wg/The%20Kid%20v2.pdf?dl=0</a><br /><br />And these are the changes:<br />-You now start with Uh, Fellow Adult Guy instead of Alright, Kid Power!<br />¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† -Reason: SJCS suggested that it&#39;d made more sense since the playbook should focus more on your weirdness being an adult in a kid&#39;s body and your interactions with the adult and child world. I concurred.<br />-Remove &quot;Explosive Outburst&quot;¬†<br />¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† -Reason: It just felt weak narrativel-y. It only really works if you transform like Captain Marvel or are Captain Marvel. It&#39;s hard to work narrative-ly if you aren&#39;t. It was also limiting.<br />-Added &quot;The Innocent Accusing Eye<br />¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† -Reason: It serves as a counter-balance to &quot;You&#39;re Such A Kid.&quot; Kids might be woefully inexperienced in life and have simplistic beliefs that are dangerous for adults to follow, but they have knack for cutting to the heart of the matter and¬†<br />¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†saying something that hits right in the heart because of their innocence and sincerity.¬†<br />-Swapped starting label value of Freak and Mundane<br />¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† -Reason: It works better to reinforce the idea people find you weird and off-putting. Also, Masks playbooks tend to make the starting, highest stat be the same stat in their automove. When switiching auto moves, it made sense to switch¬†<br />¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†these too.<br />-Added in Looks section<br />¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† -Reason: I forgot to include it before"

The Kid is primarily inspired by DC&#39;s Captain Marvel (Not Marvel&#39;s Captain Marvel). For those who don&#39;t know, Captain Marvel main gimmick is that he is a child who gains the body of an adult when he uses his powers.<br /><br />The main metaphor for the playbook was that type of young adult who clings to the idea they&#39;re still a kid. Basically, that teenager who is refusing to grow up and become an adult. While I like most of the playbook, two of the moves are a little weak.<br /><br />Anyway, without further ado, here is The Kid v.1<br />DOC:¬†<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/hcsujatwrq80jzd/The%20Kid.docx?dl=0\" class=\"ot-anchor\">https://www.dropbox.com/s/hcsujatwrq80jzd/The%20Kid.docx?dl=0</a>\nPDF:¬†<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/aj1r5axuoqgvhhp/The%20Kid%20v1.pdf?dl=0\" class=\"ot-anchor\">https://www.dropbox.com/s/aj1r5axuoqgvhhp/The%20Kid%20v1.pdf?dl=0</a><br /><br />Any comments are appreciated."

They had a deal during the &#39;Mourning War&#39; (two alien races had a throwdown on earth, one side helped us the other tried to enslave us) the &#39;good&#39; aliens provided a bio-engineered organ, similar to a heart, that pumped a bizarre hormone which reacted strongly to human physiology.<br /><br />I was implanted with the alien heart, gaining incredible powers, and fighting alongside standard soldiers and earth&#39;s heroes to try and end the war. Unfortunately, our allies suffered a tragic loss just after we pushed the &#39;bad&#39; aliens off of earth. So that ended any more help from them.<br /><br />(Unknown to me)<br />NIGHTSKY is still experimenting with a synthetic version of the alien hormone, however some unknown quality of the alien heart helps to regulate Sentinel&#39;s powers because their other subjects exposed to the hormone have become monsters with bizarre mutations called Husks.<br />Pic of husks - <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/DnmqkCn.png\" class=\"ot-anchor\">http://i.imgur.com/DnmqkCn.png</a><br />They all have one or two powers similar to Sentinel&#39;s, but they are all monstrously deformed, and very violent.<br />(/ unknown to me)<br /><br />I&#39;m still a soldier in the military, I&#39;ve recently gained the rank of Captain, and I&#39;m on Semi-Permanent assignment with STRIKE, a paramilitary enforcement and protection agency tasked with monitoring powered individuals all over the world.<br /><br />I joined the military to make a difference, I agreed to NIGHTSKY because I wanted to protect my world, being a superhero is just doing the same job I always have, just doing it for the whole world now.

(Or the legacy of the previous wielder of the artifact.)<br /><br />I don&#39;t think having a duo (see also: Cloak and Dagger) would be inherently problematic. &quot;Play a second character&quot; is already an advance option; roleplaying two distinct characters shouldn&#39;t be a huge problem. Then you just make the playbook around the duality, with Labels that apply to the duo and maybe moves that riff off of that.

I would assume both have things about renouncing their past.<br /><br />The Wonder Twins could be close to the Wielder. Both won&#39;t work without another Thing there that has it&#39;s own personality. The Venom symbiotes from Spiderman or Iron Man&#39;s suit with an AI are cases where they might overlap. It&#39;d be one of the more high concept playbooks at the actual table. The GM moves tied to the playbook could be real helpful there to not make it a weight only the Player has to carry."
