    "content": "Yesterday&#39;s Masks session saw the team sail off-world in a bone ship powered by uncomfortable truths, hoping to rescue an old-school supervillain (who could be a useful ally) from the clutches of the Rime Court. Plus, one of my players set a new bar for cosplay!<br /><br />Sonia (The Soldier) stayed on mission and also blasted off an ice-dragon&#39;s wing. Panic (The Doomed) sacrificed a tooth to a skeleton to get here, and accidentally stabbed Halfpenny (The Transformed) through the soul with a bone sword (he got better).<br /><br />Torq (The Nova) cleverly avoided drinking liquid nostalgia at a Rime Court soiree with a careful application of gravity control inside his esophagus. General Bowmaster (The Legacy) put on a show to create a distraction, but got so into the role his fae mask wouldn&#39;t come off.<br /><br />In the end, the team reached the room where Baron Devastation was enthroned/imprisoned, only to see masses of Rime Court Hunters pouring in as well. To be continued...next weekend!",

Our contributors have been wonderful, and we&#39;ve got a ton of content - articles on running masks for teenagers, one-shot modules, extra materials for play, and gorgeous fanart!!! We&#39;re going to launch on Kickstarter in February - tentatively Feb 8 - and we will have both PDFs and physical zines as rewards! <br /><br />I&#39;m super excited to tell you that we will be paying our contributors!! Depending on the amount we raise, I&#39;ll be able to pay our contributors $5-20 for their efforts. It&#39;s not much, but it&#39;s something. <br /><br />If anyone has any questions about this project, or wants a last-minute in on it, please shoot me an email at thefanfavoritezine@gmail.com. <br /><br />I&#39;m really excited about this, and will be releasing some sneak previews soon!!!!!"

    "content": "Okay, so, let&#39;s talk about my teams.<br /><br />Yes, teams, I decided that it would be funnier if there was two young hero teams that could coexist. And it was the greatest idea I&#39;ve ever had. Truly.<br /><br />My friends are the best mix between the seriousness and the funny ideas, so a Superhero RPG was the best thing I could find.<br /><br />The first team is called the Tasty Avengers (don&#39;t ask why)<br /><br />There are four members in this team : The Mask, Allan, Dr. Taste of the Night and Captain Civil Rights<br /><br />The Mask is a Janus with an incredible agility and superhuman senses. Marshall Alexander Garett was a simple High School Student, a bit of a geek and an unpoplar kid, when he received his powers with some kind of head trauma that unlocked superhuman physical abilities. As he started to use his powers, he decided to use them to become a popular kid, and he did. He joined the football team and started to be quite appreciated.<br /><br />Allan is a Doomed guy with psychic creation powers. Allan is actually a mystery for the human kind. Some call him an anomaly, others call him heresy. And they&#39;re not totally wrong. Actually, Allan is a creation, more of an error, of the gods, a creature born from the darkness. One God has swore to destroy this heathen: Helios, god of the Sun.<br /><br />Dr. Taste of the Night is a Nova that controls the gravity. Dr. Taste of the Night is a cosmic being who decided to reincarnate himself in the body of a baby Earthling. And that how he was reborned. On Earth, the little Jean Micheng (yes.) quickly decided to use his power to fight crime in Halcyon City.<br /><br />And finally, Captain Civil Rights. This transformed was the son of two kebab-makers in his old life. Though, Michel Mortecouille (yes.) wanted to be a biologist. He had an intership in a biology lab as a janitor, and the scientist wanted to test on him some kind of microscopic fungus that increased the muscles strength. After they put the fungus on him, they told him that he should not be exposed closely to sources of light. Unfortunately for him, he went to a protest against the government shortly after that and the police sent flash grenades in the crowd that he received just in front of him. After the flash occured, he was transformed in some kind of wood creature, and the yellow jacket he was wearing for the protest had fused with his skin.<br /><br />So that&#39;s it for the Tasty Avengers, neither of us are good with drawing so I don&#39;t have any images to show haha. If I see people are kinda interested I can talk about the other team and detail the scenario"

His memories have been hazy but with a big battle ahead we decided to use Microscope to see what the grim, dark future would be like.<br />The photo cards are all the PCs and NPCs and where they died in this future. All apart from Tyr who is our clueless former Legacy back in the present to change things (he reappeared in the pink post it on the top left of the first photo). Oh and King Karbon, the ruler of the Periodic Table of Evil, who destroyed reality by wrecking physics at the end of the timeline.<br /><br />This was great fun, kind of like getting to wreck all the toys we’ve built in our first two seasons of Masks. Now they need to make sure it never happens this way.",

    "content": "Hello everyone. I recently posted the summary of the previous Masks campaign that I ran (which was also the first time I GM&#39;d a Masks game). And I&#39;m currently planning for another campaign, this time utilizing the Spiderweb playset from Masks: Unbound.<br /><br />I have seen only one Actual Play of Masks (on Youtube) that used the Spiderweb playset (couldn&#39;t find any podcasts of it) so I&#39;m kind of going in blind. And I&#39;d really like some help.<br /><br />As listed in Unbound, a Neighbourhood has 1 of 5 Virtues:<br /><b>Charity, Fortitude, Justice, Renewal, Solidarity</b><br />and 1 of 5 Vices:<br /><b>Anger, Apathy, Greed, Jealousy, Laziness</b><br /><br />Unbound gives examples of Solidarity and Apathy but not the rest. In the Actual Play I saw, they also used those specific 2, leaving me at a loss of examples for the other 8.<br /><br />So, if anyone can give me some examples of the other Virtues and Vices, I&#39;d be very grateful and have a good basis to go on portraying them in my upcoming campaign.<br /><br />Thank you in advance."

    "content": "Latest Masks RPG session saw the B-Team get deeply into trouble while the Salvatores were off-world. It started simply enough: Kevin (The Beacon) got a mission to extract an undercover reporter from a gang war. He suited up and called in his semi-allies...<br /><br />Craig, a.k.a. Glow-rion (The Delinquent), was in it mostly to get his hands on more of the superpower drug Invictus. He stretched his powers to create a psychic rocket launcher and to musically befuddle a knock-off Chopbuster. But ultimately, he learned that huffing a burning cloud of Invictus is unwise, and began to re-evaluate his life.<br /><br />Adonis (The Star), now sporting a dark cape and mohawk, had a new scheme to get his acclaim-based powers back. He tried endearingly to cultivate an edgier persona, and did get a gang of Vaudvillains to believe he was his own evil twin, Tammuz.<br /><br />For Red Cent (The Reformed), it was a personal mission. Her step-dad Bounty is the drug dealer under siege...turns out it&#39;s part of his plan to fake his death and leave the biz. The two come to an understanding—just in time to team up against RC&#39;s old mentor, Penny Dreadnought.<br /><br />Kevin (as Sir Percival of Capstone) completed the mission with a Moment of Truth, stealing Bounty&#39;s ride to whisk reporter Abby Rhoades to safety. The rest of the team collapsed into recriminations and double-crosses over the Invictus supply, ultimately destroying it. Huzzah?",

    "content": "Hello everyone. This is my very first post in this Community so I&#39;m eager to see the discussion from you all.<br /><br />The Masks GM Sheets (available at <a href=\"http://www.magpiegames.com/masks/masks-playbooks-moves/\" class=\"ot-anchor\">http://www.magpiegames.com/masks/masks-playbooks-moves/</a>) suggests a certain order in which you should ask the &quot;When the team first came together...&quot; questions from the various playbooks during character creation.<br /><br />However, there is now twice the amount of playbooks compared to when the GM Sheets were created. So the sheets are quite outdated.<br /><br />Using <span class=\"proflinkWrapper\"><span class=\"proflinkPrefix\">+</span><a class=\"proflink\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/105138568577624786912\" oid=\"105138568577624786912\">Doyce Testerman</a></span>&#39;s helpful post (<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DoyceTesterman/posts/MtJujJTVVJN\" class=\"ot-anchor\">https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DoyceTesterman/posts/MtJujJTVVJN</a> which itself is slightly outdated now that Unbound is out), here&#39;s my take on the question order.<br /><br />Please review and/or criticize this ordering so we can have a more comprehensive list of questions to help GMs run their Masks campaigns more smoothly. Thank you all, in advance.<br />______________________<br /><i>The fight</i><br /><b>Bull</b>: We defeated a dangerous enemy. Who or what was it?<br /><b>Reformed</b>: We fought a terrible enemy from my old life. Who was it and what did they take from me?<br /><b>Innocent</b>: My future self was involved, and I tried to stop them. It took the rest of the team to help me succeed. How did we stymie my future self’s plans?<br /><b>Nomad</b>: We had to deal with a danger I’d met while traveling the farscapes. What was it, and how did we send it away?<br /><b>Newborn</b>: The team discovered you during the incident; thanks to them, you reached the outside world and helped in the fight. Where and how did they find you? Who gave you your first nickname?<br /><b>Nova</b>: We destroyed our surroundings in the fight. Where was it? What did we destroy?<br /><b>Outsider</b>: We didn’t trust each other at first, but that changed. How? Why?<br /><br /><i>Immediate consequence</i><br /><b>Janus</b>: We saved the life of someone important, either to the city, or to us. Who was it? Why are they important?<br /><b>Delinquent</b>: We totally broke some major rules to win the fight. What rules did we break? Whose rules were they?<br /><b>Joined</b>: The connection between our two halves was threatened by the crisis. How? By what?<br /><b>Doomed</b>: We paid a high cost for victory. What was it?<br /><b>Soldier</b>: Our victory secured an important resource for A.E.G.I.S. What was it?<br /><br /><i>Long term consequence</i><br /><b>Legacy</b>: All things considered, we did well and impressed an established hero. Who was it?<br /><b>Star</b>: We, as a team, attracted the attention of a major media outlet within the city, thanks to our efforts. Who are they? Why do they support us?<br /><b>Scion</b>: Someone important learned about my lineage and condemned us all. Who? Why?<br /><b>Transformed</b>: We drew attention and ire from plenty during the fight. One important person in particular now hates and fears us. Who is it?<br /><br /><i>The Team coming together</i><br /><b>Protégé</b>: We stuck together after all was said and done. Why? How’d we keep in contact?<br /><b>Brain</b>: I created something lasting and beneficial for the whole team.

What were the signs?<br /><b>Harbinger</b>: We averted a disaster from the future’s history books. What was the disaster? What effect do we hope it had on the timeline?<br />______________________<br />Edit: My intention of splitting the 20 questions into the 4 categories is that I think it&#39;s good to ask at least one question from each category, even if no playbook from that category is present in the campaign. It just helps flesh out the event that caused the team to come together better.",

    "content": "Hello everyone. I&#39;m very happy to have received such a warm welcome to my previous post. And I&#39;m also very happy to announce that the Masks campaign I&#39;ve been running for the past 7 months have finally come to an end last Saturday (19 January 2019).<br /><br />I made an Actual Play video series for the campaign as well as wrote down the campaign summary (which became freakishly long, as you can imagine).<br /><br />Given below is the link to the Google Doc file of the Campaign Summary which also includes link to an Imgur album which lists and credits every single art and picture we used and the Youtube Playlist for the Actual Play.<br /><br />This was my second time GMing ever and the first time I&#39;ve ever actually completed a campaign. So this was very much a learning experience for me. I made lots of rookie GMing mistakes and I hope that I can use that knowledge to run future games much better.<br /><br />Thank you for your interest and if you are insane enough to read through the following 90 pages of wall-of-text, then please let me know how you enjoyed the story and how I can do a better job.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ACVaYixw2OH9utDXrxfWbQ3yt054eUnkAYzNLapc9vI\" class=\"ot-anchor\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ACVaYixw2OH9utDXrxfWbQ3yt054eUnkAYzNLapc9vI</a><br /><br />Edit: The name of the campaign &#39;The Gauntlet&#39; refers to a series of challenges. It is not made as a reference to any gloves or the Gauntlet RPG community (whose existence I wasn&#39;t aware at the time I began the campaign)."

She sacrificed herself as a means to save a couple of others, one of which is a teen NPC who will likely become a villain in response to this tragedy.<br /><br />That had always been in the design for these two NPCs, though the way it played out involved a PC rolling a 6 on a Defend roll, so now she feels like the death is entirely her character’s fault for failing. <br /><br />The next session will likely begin with a lot of fantastic angst and grief as the characters deal with the fallout of this session (They were there because the soldier disobeyed a direct order and brought them to a fight beyond their pay grade). <br /><br />After that, I will want to lighten things up a billion percent and get everyone’s spirits up. This was Homecoming night, so we’re due a fun Halloween episode. I’d love suggestions for fun, silly, lighthearted Halloween hijinks for teen supers to deal with. What do you guys recommend?"

But in the rules I don&#39;t see any way of taking away the Influence that PCs have over someone. It&#39;s not a MC move, it&#39;s not a move for the Scion playbook, and they can&#39;t spend Respect like most characters can spend Influence.<br /><br />So for losing Respect would it be something that the NPC wouldn&#39;t like the Scion doing? It seems like it would be easier to lose Respect then gain it, is that the intended effect?"

    "content": "Something interesting about settings for Masks fights: I like a street brawl as much as the next guy, but on occasion I like to set a fight somewhere out-of-the-way, so the heroes, their enemies, and any NPCs in direct danger have a harder time simply running away, and there&#39;s a little more room for people to cut loose with powers. The obvious way to go with this is something like an abandoned warehouse, but I&#39;ve enjoyed coming up with slightly more interesting settings like:<br />-An abandoned theater<br />-A run-down bowling alley<br />-A parking garage under construction, being used as the site of a rave<br />-An aquarium, just re-opened after a previous supervillain attack<br />-A performance venue in a park, built on top of the hand of a giant alien robot (the debris from a legendary superhero battle)<br /><br />What fun setting have you found for Masks fight scenes?"

    "content": "A dramatic, family-focused Masks session last night. Fletcher Loxley (The Beacon), met his grandfather Errol—still alive and the director of F.A.T.E.! They collaborated to kidnap Fletch&#39;s mind-controlled parents, in a scene involving snipers, a rocket car, and a Moment of Truth. Fletcher changed playbooks from the Beacon to the Legacy!<br /><br />Panic (The Doomed) went home to Greenville to come clean to her parents, only to find her doppelgänger Sapphire usurping her life! The team captured Sapphire and Panic had a sweet moment with her mom Maribel—but Panic&#39;s Doom inched closer as she sprouted Rime Court horns!<br /><br />Sonia (The Soldier) used a Moment of Truth to reconnect Aislin and Furnace to the mystical Kiln. Her alliances and enmities with the various Forge scientists grew more complex. And she dealt with facing Panic and Sapphire by blasting them both, planning to sort it out later!<br /><br />Halfpenny (The Transformed) got himself exorcized, lessening Mr. Hunt&#39;s hold over him. His transmuting and telepathic powers shifted in the process, leaving him unable to return to his mundane form but able to turn his arms into strange materials and communicate with squirrels.<br /><br />Torq (The Nova) didn&#39;t blow anything up (though he needed it to be explained to him why Panic minded Sapphire usurping her family). At session&#39;s end, the team was bruised, battered, and prepping to leave this plane of reality on a quest to rescue Baron Devastation.",

Of course, that’s pretty much how things are year round there… Enjoying your new citizenship? Well pull up a blanket and try to get cozy. It’s going to be a very Darkhavian Christmas.<br /><br />Viscount Consternation, current ruler of Darkhavia, has come to Capstone with two goals in mind. The first: throw his weight around with F.A.T.E. to teach them there&#39;s a cost to kidnapping Darkhavian citizens. <br /><br />The second: make it clear to everyone at the Forge that his care for Darkhavia is so deep and so magnanimous that he will rise to the defense of even someone who deserves it as little as you do.<br /><br />That’s fine by you, of course, since you have a plan to recruit the recovering Invictus junkies at the Forge to humiliate Viscount Consternation. These kids are all jonesing for superpowers, right? Why not recruit them to the Forge’s cause and fire them up for the fight against the Rime Court. Of course, you know that Consternation can’t comply with this plan, because Nix says it will take Baron Devastation to grant fire powers to more Forgelings. But forcing Consternation to confirm this publicly should knock him down a peg, and help underline the need to bring Devastation back. That’s the idea, anyway.<br /><br />Roll +Soldier, that is, +1.<br /><br />On a hit, choose someone at the Forge to join your conspiracy. The GM will tell you what important resource or intel they bring to the table. <br /><br />But if this works, Consternation will be looking for revenge. On a 10+ choose two, on a 7-9 choose one. <br /><br />He doesn’t find a way to take his humiliation out on:<br />You, Sonia<br />Dr. Nix<br />Furnace and Aislin<br />On 6-, he turns the tables and Nix joins in (for cover, she says). Still couldn’t she have distanced herself without stooping to breaking that promise/betraying that trust? What happened and what condition do you mark?<br /><br />Hope your little scheme turns out to be worth it. Merry Christmas, Sonia Ignacio.<br /><br />XXOO,<br />Your Gamemaster<br /><br />P.S.: You haven’t been forgotten, Halfpenny. There’s still room in your stocking for a little loose change..."

She would have gone out in a blaze of rage and glory had White Owl not intervened. Now she’s got a complex relationship with the team to contend with.<br /><br />The Scion - Shawn Braddock had a hand in bringing down his father, a hero turned bad. White Owl, impressed with Shawn’s bravery and intelligence, offered him a role on the team for the opportunity to use his father’s advanced tech for good, and the chance to make things right.<br /><br />Like these characters?

    "content": "A final ChristMASKS Love Letter, for Halfpenny the Transformed (a former Protege, who also has Doom Track). This one has the hardest miss I&#39;ve ever written for a love letter or any custom move. Let&#39;s see what happens!<br /><br />Dear Halfpenny,<br /><br />The time has come, you’ve decided, for auld acquaintance to be forgot.<br /><br />You’ve learned what you can from Mr. Hunt, but this thing where he controls your body for fourteen minutes, forty seconds of each day is getting old. Time to kick him to the curb. What’s the worst that can happen? (Oh, you poor, naïve soul.)<br /><br />The Forge has been working on a way to assist you with your Bad Penny problem. The procedure is relatively simple: Two circles of salt and flame are ignited, one around you and one around the card of Mr. Hunt’s that Sonia delivered to Dr. Nix. Once the wards are secure, Candelabra will also set the business card on fire. In theory (in theory!) this should weaken Mr. Hunt’s hold on you, as he’ll also be pulled to his card and (hopefully) caught in that ward. Then the Forgeling can attempt to exorcise his remaining grip and free you.<br /><br />Only Nix and Candelabra are here. You worried about what dangers your teammates might be exposed to if they watched. You alone decided to eat the Bad Penny. You will face these consequences alone too. If this works, you can speak to your team freely without worrying about Hunt for the first time in a long time. If this doesn’t… well, it’s best they don’t have to see whatever happens to you, you think again, trying to silence the nagging thought that you’re making an even bigger mistake than before.<br /><br />Nix looks you over. “Pray this works, Halfpenny. Your situation is untenable. If this fails…” she trails off, then walks briskly to an observation station. “Candelabra, update.”<br /><br />“Ready to light.” The intense young girl steps away from the flickering barrier she’s erected around you. It doesn’t look like much, especially given your inhuman strength and bulk. But you’ve seen Candelabra work her magic before. You feel the telltale shiver of the Penny reacting to what’s going on. Is Hunt…afraid? impatient? Either way, you’ve had enough of him living rent free in your body. You give Candelabra a final thumbs up, then hunker down. You wanted to have a clever quip here, but your throat has gone dry.<br /><br />Candelabra lights the circle. Your vision woozily shifts, and once more you’re in that boxing ring with Mr. Hunt glaring at you from the other corner...<br /><br />(But, of course, there’s no way to know how your transformed body will react to all this magic. Perhaps you’ll find yourself even more monstrous by the time the ritual is done.)<br /><br />Roll +your +1 forwards on the Bad Penny, that is, +3.<br /><br />On a hit, Mr. Hunt’s presence within you is curbed. A part of him remains within your mind, but much of him is banished to…elsewhere. Clear a Doomsign.<br /><br />On a 10+, you manage to ask Mr. Hunt a question as this goes down. The GM will give you an honest answer. Then choose one complication from below.<br /><br />On a 7-9, choose two complications.<br /><br />—The nature of your transmuting flesh shifts radically. You can do freakier things, like coat a whole arm in metal or form spiky protrusions, but you can no longer shift back into your mundane Felipe form.<br /><br />—Your animal telepathy kicks into overdrive. Now you realize that you can reach out to mammals…but being around them when they’re excited can cause painful feedback that makes you risk losing control of your powers.<br /><br />—Wherever you go, coins are attracted to you as if by magnetism. They propel themselves towards you and embed in your flesh.<br /><br />On a miss, things go very badly. Mr. Hunt was wilier than you thought. Instead of him being exorcized, you are booted from your body and find your mind floating in the ether, unmoored. Mr. Hunt has full control over the body that, once, was yours.<br /><br />What is it like being a free-floating spirit in the in-between? What does Halfpenny see or experience there that is most disturbing? Mark an appropriate condition. Then make your doom track thrice. Then tell me how you get in touch with Panic psychically to plead for help.<br /><br />Happy New Year, Felipe Farthing. Hope you get the chance to see it.<br /><br />XXOO,<br />Your Gamemaster<br /><br />P.S. What, you expect more love letters? Not a chance. Go on, get out of here! There’ll be adventure enough on Saturday."

    "content": "A ChristMASKS Love Letter for Panic, the former Delinquent, now Doomed. I&#39;m incorporating the advance she took (move from another playbook: Kirby-Craft) and some consequences for her recent arrest and escape.<br /><br />Dear Panic,<br /><br />Ho ho ho. <br /><br />Well, you’re sprung. But you were locked away from your cloak for a little while. As soon as you get combobulated, you notice two important things: your right arm and the whole right side of your torso is cold to the touch. And there are tiny little horns starting to poke out of your forehead! Your immediate worry is about how to explain this to Uncle Cas and the rest of your family. Fortunately, your bangs are able to cover the horns…at least for now.<br /><br />When you fish your phone out of the bag of belongings Kevin and his team snagged, your heart drops. There are sixteen missed calls and nine voicemails from Uncle Cas.<br /><br />Dreading facing your guardian, and remembering that he’d said he’d have to tell your parents if you got arrested again, you decide to first check in at the Sanctuary. Edith is pleased to hear how you helped so many kids who’d been ensnared by the Rime Court to possibly get free. (In your telling, you minimize the fact you’d handed them over to the Forge.) But she is distraught by the ever-growing effects of your curse. She thinks the teleportation powers you discovered are not safe to rely on. “You’ll just turn faster that way, Elodie. But if it’s transportation you need, the Sanctuary can provide.”<br /><br />With Edith’s help, you summon a ship made of bones.<br /><br />Tell us about your bone ship. What does Panic call it? And what’s the exotic fuel source you’ve chosen for it?<br /><br />Then, it’s time to talk to Uncle Cas. You have a plan: come clean about the prison thing, and let him know you’re actively planning to tell your parents (and, most frighteningly, your mom) about your superhero exploits. You talked to your aunt about it and everything! Surely that should be good enough for him, right? You can even show him your bone ship and offer to bring him along to Greenville.<br /><br />Roll +Mundane. [If you don’t know this, I can tell you soon.] On a 10+, you mostly get what you want. But choose one complication. On a 7-9, choose two.<br /><br />You frighten Uncle Cas with your powers and the danger you’re in. Mark your doom track.<br />Uncle Cas’s distressed emotional reaction to your situation rattles you. Mark a condition.<br />Demonstrating your bone ship summoning without Edith’s guidance leads you to overexert yourself. Mark your doom track.<br /><br />On a miss, Uncle Cas is teary-eyed but stern. He wants you to understand how in over your head you are. Choose one of the above complications, and the GM will shift your labels. Cas shows a copy of the letter he’s already mailed to your parents. If you want to break the truth to the Greenville family your way, you’ll have to beat the postal service there.<br /><br />Well, no bones about it, Panic. Christmas is a time for family.<br /><br />XXOO,<br />Your Gamemaster<br /><br />P.S.: Stay tuned, other Salvatores. I hear jingle bells on their way. Jingle. Jingle."

    "content": "Ran the convention RPG in one day with two GMs, and almost 10 players. (14 scheduled, a total of nine PC participants, &#39;tho not all at once.) It was awesome, getting to have so many players, splitting and combining groups. The real interesting part was the finale, where the only unpicked character, Huma, came back under mind control to fight the other players. (Including Toro who found him tremendously annoying and declared him her Rival.) <br /><br />A moment of truth brought Rook industries down (I would hate to have to insure that place.) But the real twist was Rosa Rook was a space alien, the exact same type as Skysong! I love it when an off-the-cuff idea ties all eight or so plot lines together.<br />Shout out to my ships: Skysong/Grasshopper, Toro/Vertex (they fell in love when Toro saved him from a gang), And mega props to Carbine, for sniping three consecutive heroes and occupying a fourth during her escape. (So many misses.)<br /><br /><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/526623568235200514/528724261670617088/unknown.png\" class=\"ot-anchor\">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/526623568235200514/528724261670617088/unknown.png</a>",

    "content": "Another Merry ChrisMASKS love letter I&#39;ve sent out to a player, the Beacon named Fletcher Loxley (who recently upgraded his codename from Captain Bowmaster to General Bowmaster). <br /><br />Dear Fletch,<br /><br />All right, big shot. You’re alive and out of jail. And you’re a general now, apparently. But what will you do when the battle comes home to you?<br /><br />Fletch wakes up at Kevin’s parents’ garage, and gets a confused recap of the rescue mission from Kevin—and Craig (?) and apparently Katya was involved but also Red Cent turned up (?!) and something big happened with the mayor… but the biggest thing Fletch hears is something disturbing about his parents. What happened in the mayor’s office after he jumped into the painting? Fletch races home to find out.<br /><br />Back home everything seems…weirdly unchanged. Bart is reading the paper, Evelyn is making spaghetti. But it all seems a little too normal, like that one film of your grandfather’s, &quot;The Stridebridge Husbands.&quot; Tell us about some very usual details here that now strike you as disturbing. <br /><br />Of course you want to get to the bottom of this…but also a part of you doesn’t, since your parents seem totally unstressed and fine for the first time in a while and your dad isn’t even taking issue with your superheroing. Roll +Savior and -Mundane, that is, +1.<br /><br />On a hit, ask the GM a question that he will answer honestly. Then tell us how you uncovered the answer.<br /><br />On a 10+, take +1 forward on one of your parents. How are you preparing for facing off with them in one way or another?<br /><br />On a 7-9, you get your answer, but it costs you. What aspect of normal life can’t be the same for Fletch anymore? Why is this important to you?<br /><br />On a miss, you give away a teammate’s secret while attempting to investigate. How? Whose secret? Mark an appropriate condition. What grand gesture are you now planning to make it up to them?<br /><br />Merry Christmas, Fletcher Loxely.<br /><br />XXOO,<br />Your GM<br /><br />P.S.: Waiting to find out if you’re on the naughty or nice list, other Salvatores? Sit tight, you’ll know soon enough..."

I used the mechanic of bonuses for answers rather than stats because none of us have access to the players&#39; playbooks while traveling over the holidays. The love letter follows the former Outsider, now the Nova, at his new school situation. One of his classmates is Bernice/Candelabra, a worryingly intense little girl from the Soldier&#39;s organization:<br /><br />Dear Torq,<br /><br />Well, well, well. Once again, you have been plucked from imprisonment by your resourceful friends. I guess you must be feeling like you dodged a bullet. Flush with luck and untouchable by the cares of the world. Little do you know what new challenge awaits you in your civilian life: A group project book report!<br /><br />That’s right. The good sisters at St. Rose of Lima’s Caritas schooling program have paired up students to read a work of edifying non-fiction and deliver a book report or creative presentation on it to their classmates. As luck would have, Cody Nicholson and Bernice [fake last name] are assigned to collaborate.<br /><br />Answer the following questions honestly and take +1 for each “Yes”:<br />Is Torq is able to focus on the assignment, given everything else going on in his life?<br />Is Torq is able to collaborate well with Candelabra, given her eccentricities?<br />Is Torq able to frame their report or presentation for an audience of humans, given their alien worldview?<br /><br />Tell us what book you’re reporting on. Then, roll +any relevant bonuses. No matter the result, describe something about the report or presentation.<br /><br />On a 10+, choose two. On a 7–9, choose one:<br />Shift labels as you choose, moving Mundane, Superior, or Savior up and another label down. How did this project affect Torq’s self-image?<br />Take Influence over Candelabra. How did you two bond during your group assignment?<br />Take Influence over Sr. Lucia Marie. How did you positively surprise her with your work?<br /><br />On a 7–9, also tell us how the book’s material was particularly difficult or upsetting for Torq and how he dealt with that.<br /><br />On a miss, tell us how Torq manages to bungle this report, and why this failure is important. Mark an appropriate condition. What foolhardy action is he now planning?<br /><br />Merry Christmas, Cody Nicholson. <br /><br />XXOO,<br />Your GM<br /><br />P.S.: Don’t worry, other Salvatores. Santa hasn’t forgotten you. And Christmas is a season, not a day..."

We agreed I&#39;d run a one-shot for the final session of the year where all our players could try on new playbooks and characters by being NPCs and putting together a b-team.<br /><br />I told them I&#39;d just come up with a problem that the usual team wouldn&#39;t be a good fit to solve, but what Alexi and I agreed is that the preceding session would end with the main team captured by our A.E.G.I.S. equivalent. He got a shot to take us down in the session, for everyone who escaped, I had this move as mop-up.<br /><br />My goal in writing the custom move was to give players a real reward for escaping the first time, it&#39;s just that their reward is getting the shape the circumstances of their capture. They get to pick how they want to go down and what complications that might set up for the future.<br /><br /><br />When you <b>get captured</b>, roll +Conditions to tell us how it all goes down:<br /><br />On a 10+ it gets ugly, choose one:<br />• They took you down in a public place, and blackened your name. What did they claim about you? What person or persons did you lose influence over?<br />• You lost control of your powers trying to escape. Who did you hurt and why do you feel so guilty?<br />• Choose two from 7-9<br /><br />On a 7-9, somewhere or someone you thought was safe wasn’t, what happened? Choose one:<br />• You are ambushed somewhere you thought was secret or safe. What happened?<br />• Your captors threatened someone you cared about if you didn’t turn yourself in. Who did they threaten? Why did you have to give in?<br />• Your captors had something prepped specifically to neutralize your powers. What happened? Mark an appropriate condition.<br /><br />On a 6-, you’re still captured, but you conducted yourself with honor and you managed to learn an important piece of information that you relayed to Kevin before they got you. <br />• Choose a question from pierce the mask/assess the situation for Leah to answer. And tell us something badass you did as they took you down.<br />"

You’re out of the fight until she is.<br />* Agent Njeri has her hooks in you and can immediately roll one of your moves (basic or playbook) to target a teammate through you.<br />* Two from the 7-9 list<br /><br />On a 7-9, choose one:<br />* You give up a damaging secret of yours or a teammate’s to Njeri through your memories. What is it? Mark a condition.<br />* Agent Njeri blurs your grasp of reality. You’re having trouble avoiding seeing her as [person you care about]. Take -1 ongoing to rolls targeting her.<br />* Any option from the usual powerful blow 7-9 list. <br /><br />On a 6-, explain how you reframe a bad memory, and take +1 forward against Agent Njeri.

Not one, but two Moments of Truth, plus the team faced the menace of the Calamity Crew, a black ops team of collared supervillains dispatched to bring them in...with several members nursing personal grudges against them.<br /><br />Panic (The Doomed) discovered that her missing classmate Nadia was actually the speedster supervillain Spatterdash, locked up in a F.A.T.E. prison. Panic used her Moment of Truth to spring Spatterdash, and other kids she thought were being held in unjust conditions.<br /><br />Halfpenny (The Transformed) learned to shift between his monstrous and human forms, but also faced consequences of signing over control of his body to the sinister Mr. Hunt for 14min, 40sec a day. He learned that, controlled by Hunt, he&#39;d authorized an attack on a teammate&#39;s mom!<br /><br />General Bowmaster (The Beacon) raced to City Hall to save his mom, the deputy mayor. He bonded with his dad along the way, but when they arrived his mom seemed hypnotized, and Bowmaster leapt into the sinister painting that was responsible—only to be captured by evil forces!<br /><br />In the Calamity Crew ambush, Sonia (The Soldier) traded blows with Chopbuster, only to realize to her chagrin he was Jim Keaton (a man she&#39;d paralyzed) in an experimental power suit. Fleeing the fight, unleashing her powers, she turned utterly into flame—and was snuffed out!<br /><br />Torq&#39;s (The Nova) reality-warping Moment of Truth sent the Calamity Crew packing, though not before he learned that Uproar was an alien whose homeworld had been wiped out by Torq&#39;s own former homeworld. It seemed like the Salvatores, minus 2 members, had a hard-won victory...<br /><br />...But you can&#39;t fight F.A.T.E. forever, and the law caught up to our heroes, with every single PC captured at the end of the session.

    "content": "<b>Pax Unplugged 2018 Play Report</b><br /><br />Pax Unplugged was my onramp to <b>Masks</b>. After hearing about the game through the <b>BAMF</b> and <b>Whelmed</b> podcasts, I decided to give the game a go at the <i>Games on Demand</i> room at <i>Pax Unplugged 2017</i>. Which was a good enough advertisement that I marched up to the Magpie booth and made my purchase.<br /><br />Since then, I introduced Masks at my FLGS Indie Gameday, which segued into a monthly game, and I also ran it at Camp NC Gameday, where it was the best received game I ran.<br /><br />But it occurred to me that I would be running masks at NCGD and other venues again this year and I would likely have some repeat players. Though the collaborative character building introduces fresh elements in one-shots, I still needed to step up my stable of skeleton scenarios to allow for variety in play experience. Further, several supplements have been published since then, and experienced players might want to try new playbooks and playsets.<br /><br />Thus I resolved to create what I call a &quot;one-shot kit&quot;, which I had previously done for other games.<br /><br /><b>The One-shot Kit</b><br /><br />What I call a &quot;one-shot kit&quot; is a step between a pre-written scenario and on-the-fly creation. It&#39;s a short bundle of resources that I use when GMing a game where I don&#39;t know what the scenario will be when I sit down at the table.<br /><br />My reasons for needing a one-shot kit for Masks is slightly different for Masks than for Traveller. For Traveller, I created the one-shot kit to facilitate sandbox play. <br /><br />For Masks, I needed something that would:<br />1) Give repeat players different experiences, and<br />2) Facilitate flexible scenarios that I can &quot;plug in&quot; to ideas created during the playbook character creation.<br />3) Allow exploring supplemental playbooks and playsets. This is less a &quot;need&quot; than a &quot;want&quot;; I was interested in exploring some of the material introduced in supplements that I may never get to try out at my own table in the current ongoing game.<br /><br />So I wrote up a page for each playset, including the &quot;default&quot; Halcyon City situation as well as three of the <i>Masks Unbound</i> playsets: Iron Red Soldiers, the Spiderweb, and Apocalypse Sonata. I could have written up one for Phoenix Academy, but as I have been running my players in my local game in Rook Academy, I wasn&#39;t interested in exploring it. I started a page for Secrets of AEGIS, but didn’t finish that page as I was less interested in it.<br /><br />The kit includes an intro primer &quot;script&quot; page, one page for each playset, as well as a few pages of stock villains (which I use in addition to the deck of villainy) and one page summarizing the GM moves for the supplemental playbooks (the GM sheets have these for the core playbooks).<br /><br />Each playset page has:<br />1) A listing of recommended, &quot;advanced&quot;, and &quot;banned&quot; playbooks. I ban the <i>Joined</i> in all playsets (too convoluted for one-shot play), otherwise it&#39;s written to address the feel of the playset.<br />2) A short list of inspirational media I can rattle off to the players<br />3) A list of scenario &quot;skeletons&quot;<br />4) A list of complications that can be used to add nuance and gameplay possibilities to the session, as well as &quot;plug-in points&quot; for material the players create during character generation.<br />5) A list of stock villains (either from Deck of Villainy, or new villains I am re-using from my home game.)<br /><br /><b>Pax Unplugged Sessions</b><br /><br />My intent was to survey the table to see how many players were already experienced with Masks. If the majority of players were new, I would use the default playset, otherwise offer one of the supplemental playsets.<br /><br />The reality: one of my sessions was all newbies, and one was 3/5 newbies, so I ran the default Halcyon City setup for both sessions.<br /><br />In the default scenario, my intent was to offer all core playbooks but the Doomed to new players. (The Magpie crew apparently thinks of the Nova as an advanced playbook as well and exclude it from their pre-printed packets, so I added that to my &quot;advanced&quot; list on the fly.) Experienced players could request any playbook they could name (minus the Joined). It takes enough to explain just the core playsets to new players that I think explaining all the supplemental playbooks would eat up too much time.<br /><br /><b>Saturday: Chaos (Khaos?) at the Christmas Party</b><br /><br />This session was all new players, a group of friends. Their characters:<br />• Flow (The Protégé) - Student of the established hero Hustle. <br />• Kid Khaos (The Legacy) - Arrogant entitled scion of a hero family<br />• Query (The Delinquent) - Got psychic weapons and teleportation powers from an encounter with an alien spacecraft for &quot;reasons unknown&quot;. (The player for this one left early)<br />• K-17 (The Outsider) (?) - Shape shifting alien described as looking like a &quot;green mattress&quot;. Not a stretch to think of Gumby<br />• The Element (The Janus) - Son of politicians who are trying to pass supers-control regulations.<br /><br />One of my major stock skeleton plots is &quot;the players are at a public place that gets attacked&quot;. I decided to re-used the premise and villain I originally used in the first game I GMed: Nano (from the Deck of Villainy) attacks a Christmas party being throw at his father&#39;s company, Astro Robotics.<br /><br />Tapping into the elements the players created, Kid Khoas put on a contest in which the heroes in attendance would be there on dates that were auctioned off for charity. But of course, The Element had a date there in his secret identity and Kid Khaos blindsided him with the heroic-ID charity date thing, because he&#39;s a Janus and of course has these sorts of complications. Additional flavor came in the form of the dates the heroes would have to deal with. Some are vapid children of wealthy families; others are geeky superfans who ask the wrong questions. If this wasn&#39;t a one-shot with limited time, I could have gone so much deeper with this.<br /><br />Masks tends to naturally complicate things, so I kept the action going a long time just on that premise. But the building was saved and Nano sent packing with about 45 minutes left, so I pulled out one of my stock twists: &quot;The heroes stop the thief, established heroes and/or the news give accolades , but they discover the easily-stopped thief was a ruse or distraction, and they have to go after the sneakier thief that got away.&quot;<br /><br />When they went back to the building after saving the bigwigs kidnapped by Nano, AEGIS was on the scene, and all guests at the party were accounted for... except for The Element&#39;s date, who went missing early. Of course, she&#39;s secretly a manipulative assassin-thief villain (in my head, an expy of <i>The Operative</i> from <i>Sentinels of the Multiverse</i>), who had snuck into secret vault that has been there since the days of Nano&#39;s father&#39;s old super-team. There she was stealing the biotech of Grendel, an old hero secretly turned villain. There were lots of neat props for the players to use in their moves (by this time they get the whole fiction-and-move thing), which made for a nice final fun bash in which the true villain monologues about how easily Nano was manipulated while beating them down with her biomorphically altered form.<br /><br /><b>Sunday: Treachery at the Tech Expo</b><br /><br />This session had three newbies (a father and his two sons), and two experienced players (one of them being my daughter). I let the experienced players pick playbooks from supplements. They chose the <i>Scion</i> and the <i>Reformed</i>. It seemed like having that much criminal background in the same session might be too much, but it actually gave them lots of ways to logically link their characters, so it worked out.<br /><br />The characters were:<br />Kid Legacy (The Legacy): Son of established hero Legacy, with shadow powers. Played by the younger son.<br />Aliotech (The Outsider): Somewhat Starfire-like hero exiled from an alien society that he did not fit in. Played by the father.<br />Blur (The Janus): Phasing and weapons, works as an intern at a tech company. Played by the older son.<br />Alloyed (The Reformed): Ex-villain with metal-shaping powers. Did not publicly repent or serve time, just came out with new hero identity after she had a change of heart. Played by my daughter.<br />Prestige (The Scion): Son of a magic villain and tech-thief Showtime, who avoided the takedown of some villain group because he was more like a supplier than a frontline combatant. Prestige has his own magical talents that he has turned to fighting crime.<br /><br />Again, I went with &quot;heroes are at a public place under attack&quot; premise. This time, Blur&#39;s background as a tech company intern and Prestige&#39;s father&#39;s role as a technology thief made the Tech Expo premise the obvious one. The expo is one marketing anti-super tech to places in the world that have a supervillain presence but lack the superhero presence of Halcyon. As the demonstration of a giant mecha-like suit is about to begin, the suit animates and grabs the pilot before he can climb in!<br /><br />The initial action here is less complicated than the Christmas Party scenario, and the group more experienced. Having experienced players showcase powers and moves helped get the new players up to speed. So we cut to the twist a lot earlier in this scenario. Before the fight with the rogue mecha was done, Kid Legacy&#39;s shadow-senses lets him detect the Tech-Ninjas sneaking into a nearby building. At first the action is split into two areas, with Kid Legacy and Blur taking on the Tech-Ninjas while the rest are still struggling with the mecha.<br /><br />The vault heist is where the meat of the hijinks occurs, including Prestige feigning a heel-turn to get the trust of the Tech-Ninjas getaway team, and a move to save the magic apocalypse sword that ends up delivering the sword to the hands of Raum, the Black Knight-esque evil client.<br /><br />From here, there is a brief investigation and roleplaying scene as the young heroes profess their innocence (they were the last people seen entering the building) and track down Raum and his lackeys at a site that lets them unleash the sword. There they have the final confrontation.<br /><br /><b>Impressions</b><br /><br />I wasn’t sure how the audience was going to look for Pax Unplugged, but was a little disappointed that I didn’t get a chance to toy with one of the alternate playsets. I think the gameday circuit is more likely to have more experienced players.<br /><br />Nonetheless, running Masks is always a joy. In particular, though, I love how young new players quickly embrace the system and get excited about the cool stuff their heroes can do. This made the Sunday game my favorite of the two.<br /><br />Overall, the One-shot kit seems to meet its intent, though I only really used the material for the default playset. Having a fairly simple scenario makes it fairly easy to attach bits from the backstories that the players created, and the “twist list” seems to be enough grist to keep the session interesting. Masks’ move mechanism tends to naturally introduce enough wrinkles into the game that not much more is needed.<br /><br />As for Pax Unplugged itself: the RPG experience is improved from last year, but still needs a lot of work:<br />1) The system requires you to get up early and queue up if you want to get in an RPG.<br />2) The scheduling and seating for some events was chaotic. My oldest daughter signed up for a game (not in the Magpie room) only to find that the spot they thought they had to play had been claimed, and the game she was promised didn’t fire.<br />3) As smoothly as the Magpie stuff went, we still rely on the administrative wherewithal of wonderful people like Kate to make it happen. If you want a game from a company who hasn’t staked a claim to their own room… good luck.<br /><br />While I am on the topic, super special thanks to Kate Bullock for making the Magpie events happen, and making a positive environment to play in!<br />"

    "content": "I got to run Masks for Magpie at PAX, and I&#39;m really pleased with how it went. I think my setup makes for a good, tweakable one-shot or intro to Masks. I&#39;ll describe my basic setup, and where I think you can MadLibs it a little.<br /><br /><b>The Setup:</b><br /><br />The team is asked to assist in a prison transfer. Cold Snap (from the Deck of Villainy) is being moved from prison to a courthouse cell for trial.<br /><br /><br /><b>Act I:</b><br /><br />Conflict with A.E.G.I.S. who, at least in our scenario, weren&#39;t the ones who called in the team, and felt they might cause more trouble. (Esp. as Cold Snap&#39;s backstory is being a former teen hero who went bad after losing her teammates in what the world considers and unfortunate &quot;accident.&quot;<br /><br />Cold Snap breaks out of the armored car.<br /><br /><br /><b>Act II:</b><br /><br />At some point during the fight, it becomes clear that Cold Snap isn&#39;t working alone. Her power-suppressing handcuffs were tampered with, someone is firing tranqs at the A.E.G.I.S. agents. As the fight goes on and the team Assesses, Pierces the Mask, etc. it will become clear that the person who helped Cold Snap break out isn&#39;t trying to help her <i>escape</i>.<br /><br />The A.E.G.I.S. agents are being targeted with tranqs, but the sniper is aiming bullets at Cold Snap (and, eventually, the team). It&#39;s Carbine, the rogue A.E.G.I.S. agent who lethally targets dangerous heroes. She helped Cold Snap break out, because it was too hard to take her out in the prison.<br /><br /><b>Act III:</b> <br /><br />Play to find out. The players may decide to help Cold Snap escape to save her life. They may want to help A.E.G.I.S. recapture her (and try to bargain with Carbine to avoid lethal force). It&#39;s up to them and to you.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>In my game</b>  <br /> The players initially were trying to recapture Cold Snap, though several of them felt sympathetic when she said (marking Guilty) that her team was assassinated and she was going after the perps when she was arrested. Once Carbine turned up, the team worked with the one A.E.G.I.S. agent left standing, took down Carbine, but then, their trust in A.E.G.I.S. damaged, helped Cold Snap escape to the Legacy&#39;s home.<br /><br /><br /><b>Customizing the scenario</b><br /><br />Who tells the team to step in? <br />In our case, the message came from the city councilman they saved in &quot;When the Team First Came Together&quot; who asked for help on the DL, leaving them in conflict with A.E.G.I.S. when they turned up.<br /><br />What really happened to Cold Snap&#39;s team?  <br />A nice place to tie in the Doomed&#39;s nemesis, the Legacy&#39;s family enemy, the &quot;start of something bigger&quot; from the Beacon&#39;s answer, etc. I went with the last, and gave them a stinger of the wealthy industrialist being informed Cold Snap was loose and might be able to put the pieces together at last. <br /><br />Of course, it could just be Carbine.   <br />"

    "content": "For our third bio we have a bit of a long one:<br /><br />Farah was quite literally born to be hero. Her ancestry, through her father, can be traced back to the legendary hero Gilgamesh. Throughout the centuries, these descendants have taken up the mantle of Gilgamesh to fight injustice and protect the weak. They are aided by an Ensi, originally an attendant but now a full fledged sidekick, who would inherit the Gilgamesh mantle when the time came. But this was not to be Farah’s fate; as tradition dictated the role of Ensi be given to the first son, which was Farah’s older brother Darius. When Darius was asked to take on the title at age 13, he eagerly accepted. This left Farah growing up not really having to worry much about superhero matters, though that didn’t stop her from using the legendary speed she inherited to become a track star at school. However, as Darius got older, he began to ignore his new duties, instead going to parties and hanging around with friends his parents disapproved of. This created tension between Darius and his father, which often culminated in loud angry arguments, which led to more arguments between his mother and father. His mother believing Darius simply needed to “get it out of his system” and leave him be so he can take responsibility later, and his father insisting he should take responsibility now. In the middle of all of this was Farah, fearing that every argument would be the one that causes her family to fall apart. It was this fear that motivated her to propose that she take up the role of Ensi in her brother’s stead and, in her mind, end the problem that was fracturing her family. While her father initially denied this proposition out of tradition; as Darius continued to neglect his role, he eventually relented. A suit of armour was made for her in the Forge, and she was given access to the family’s legendary armoury. Farah proved to be a capable Ensi, working well in tandem with her father. But when an extraterrestrial scientist, a reformed super criminal, and two superpowered teens show up, Gilgamesh assigns Ensi to lead this rag-tag group as a superhero team, mostly so that they can be kept under close watch. Her first real assignment on her own, Farah hopes that she can not only prove that she can handle herself on her own, but that she is also worthy of upholding her family’s legacy.<br /><br />If you&#39;d like to listen to her and the rest of the ragtag teens you can listen to their adventures here: <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/lttn-podcast/sets/ragtag-teens-season-1\" class=\"ot-anchor\">https://soundcloud.com/lttn-podcast/sets/ragtag-teens-season-1</a><br /><br />Art by our resident Artist Joe.

The plan involved calling a press conference to convince people he hadn&#39;t lost his powers at all. Of course, zombies attacked, led by General Decay on a WAR SKELEPHANT.<br /><br />Sonia burned through the zombies, and Torq decapitated General Decay (the head was still alive/undead).

I&#39;m a part of a Masks Discord, and we just finished up character creation contest (with the Unbound Book as a prize!), and we&#39;re starting to work on our next big project. This time, we&#39;re aiming even higher! <br /><br />We want to judge the community&#39;s interest in creating an RPG Zine for Masks! <br /><br />Zines are collaborative, community-generated pieces of content that can be bought, sold, and traded. Zines often include art, one-shot modules, extra moves, maps, and anything else that would be &#39;extra information&#39; for your RPG. If we get enough contributors, we&#39;d be able to run a Kickstarter to print this zine, and donate all profits to charity (perhaps Superhero Foundation or Capes4Kids). <br /><br />If this sounds like a cool thing you&#39;d be interested in contributing to, take a few minutes and fill out this survey, which we will be keeping open for a weeks. Feel free to share this survey with your friends:"

She didn&#39;t find a use for these powers until a Superhero accidentally sabotaged her friend&#39;s first chance to walk again. She was approached by the super villain Dr. Eternal and given a chance to exact her revenge on the hero that wronged her. Despite aiding in the capture of said hero, he was murdered in front of her before she could get the closure she so desperately desired. After her &quot;employer&quot; congratulated her on defeating his rival he revealed his plan, something so horrendous that Valerie was forced to take action. Handing in her resignation with a literal knife to the back, Valerie was publicly shown executing Dr. Eternal on the broadcast where he intended to announce his victory. Ostracized from the villain community and not exactly in the Heroes&#39; good books due to her murderous actions, Valerie adopted the name Orchid and now seeks to atone for her past mistakes.<br /><br />If you&#39;d like to listen to her and the rest of the ragtag teens you can listen to their adventures here: <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/lttn-podcast/sets/ragtag-teens-season-1\" class=\"ot-anchor\">https://soundcloud.com/lttn-podcast/sets/ragtag-teens-season-1</a>",

That&#39;s fine.<br /><br />The problem, if it is a problem, is this - the abilities are mostly for (1) narration rights, which of course might bring in any move, and (2) tying them into rolls on Unleash Your Powers.<br /><br />Given that Unleash Your Powers is for things like overcoming obstacles and reshaping the environment and extending your senses, brainstorm with me a bit on what tying Unleash Your Powers to &quot;Impossible fighting skills&quot; would look like. (to me, this particilar ability feels on-brand for the Playbook, but narrowly defined, so it&#39;s hard to see it as much more than justification for a high Danger)."

    "content": "So, the last thread was really cluttered and the Playbook for The Persona has moved....so insanely far from what it was to what it is I feel it&#39;s more appropriate to re-post this. There&#39;s a lot I could say about this Playbook. That no one asked for it (except someone did), that it doesn&#39;t need to exist (too late), that it&#39;s totally not what I intended to make (it really...isn&#39;t), that it&#39;s the longest time I&#39;ve spent on a single Playbook (it is by a massive margin and I know we&#39;re not done here), that a Multi-Class Playbook is just not a thing, that a PVP book is absolutely not something Masks needs or the system supports, that I&#39;m running out of things to say,  that you can save money by switching to some insurance company.<br /><br />But really there isn&#39;t that much more to say. The Persona is meant to fill in the role of a hero that needs to take extreme measures to fight the good fight. He&#39;s the ends that the means can&#39;t justify. He&#39;s the shadow of the team, but he&#39;s part of the team all the same. <br /><br />I took out a lot of stuff for this. Really whitteled it down to what it needed to be. I reworked the Token system to the point it went away. I reworked the Darkness mechanic until most of the rolling should be done by roleplaying. Like the game intends. It went from A Doomed+Janus concept to its own thing. The mission you have should be part of the overall story. The bonuses you get should help no matter what Persona you&#39;re wearing. The moves support someone who leans on their hero side, their alias side or tries to balance both. The Relationships are way better now.<br /><br />It&#39;s a new playbook.<br /><br />I am eager to present to you, for the first time and not the first time, The Persona. Catch me next time before the curtain falls on G+ for The Advocate<br /><br /><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jUPDtR_9bEVRPVCNgv8t8WVWAFccx7WPjZZk6nAdbUk/edit\" class=\"ot-anchor\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jUPDtR_9bEVRPVCNgv8t8WVWAFccx7WPjZZk6nAdbUk/edit</a>"

    "content": "Our latest Masks session was a MUSICAL EPISODE. The team attends a meeting of Parents Against Invictus to scope out the mayor. But who&#39;s that, bent on kidnapping the mayor? None other than...The Conductor!<br /><br />The Conductor had the power to compel people to sing (and by doing so, exert control over them). General Bowmaster (The Beacon—w/ new art!) was hesitant to fight him because his persona strongly resembled that of Bowmaster&#39;s grandfather in the film The Phantasm of the Orchestra.<br /><br />GB sang an Italian opera number about his conflicted feelings. Halfpenny (The Transformed) sang a Sinatra-esque duet with the Bad Penny he swallowed about the struggle for his soul. Sonia (The Soldier) sang—to the tune of West Side Story&#39;s &quot;America&quot;—of her worries about her powers.<br /><br />All those songs were essentially improvised by my wonderful players! I had a couple songs prepped for the NPCs, including a Red Cent song to the Tetris theme. Ultimately, The Conductor was defeated, but the Salvatores remain suspicious of the mayor—and, now, vice versa.",

The DC and Marvel universes are full of examples of dark, street-level stories that take place in a world full of costumed heroes.

    "content": "Influence Pedalling Playbook Addition<br /><br />In the first few games of Masks it was really hard for the players to give, take, lose or use Influence over other characters because they had written down on their playbooks whether they had influence over character, or if they had given influence to a character.  And because it was written on the sheet, and no one wanted to erase these notes, it got to the stage where players were collecting influence, but not using it (or losing it) because of a lack of an eraser.<br /><br />I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;ve had this issue, but as the GM it was annoying.<br /><br />I know we could use the Influence Cards but... yours truly does tend to forget to bring them to the game, they do tend to get lost on the table, and how do you keep a record between games of who has what influence?<br /><br />So, what I came up with is an Influence Pedalling addition to the playbooks where we use Post-It notes (which I call Influence Tags) to keep track of whom a character has influence over, a section to keep a supply of Post-It notes of your characters Influence Tags that have not yet been handed to anyone in the game (every character should have 1 tag for every PC in the game) and a section to note down which adults no longer have influence over the character.<br /><br />(See the attached photos in comment section)<br /><br />After setting this addition to the playbooks up the players actually started trading influence, and using them against other characters because it was so easy to hand the influence tags between the players with no additional writing needed.  It was easy and the players liked it.<br /><br />Anyway, your mileage may vary, but if you want to try this out for yourselves here is the Influence Pedalling sheet I made.",

    "content": "How do you share the action between players?<br /><br />One issue that I have had in Masks is with players (ok, and GMs) who have come out of D&amp;D, Champions or other turn based combat system RPGs.  PbtA is a free flowing narrative combat system with rolling for major actions (moves) - and the GM is meant to flip back and forth between players when it is right for the narrative not because of an initiative chart.<br /><br />However, this freedom means that it can feel very lopsided to players more used to a strict order of combat, especially as the NPCs get a move after every move a PC makes; sometimes players feel that their character are not getting enough screen time; and then &quot;hey, when is my character going to get a go&quot; becomes a common complaint (even if the player only just a minute ago made a spectacular move and other character are having the spotlight on them now).<br /><br />My group of 6 - 8 players brain-stormed this idea after one game where I, as GM, felt that the spotlight was shining fairly evenly on the characters, but some of the players felt that in the combats their characters were not getting enough attention.<br /><br />Our solution?  Poker chips and an icecream bucket.  Every player gets a poker chip at the start of the session and then, once we get into a combat type situation, when a player &quot;makes a move&quot; they throw their chip in the bucket.  Once everyone has thrown their chips in the bucket, or the combat ends, we hand the chips back out to everyone and start again.  We still get the narrative style free flowing combat feel of the game, but now when a player asks &quot;Hey, when is my character going to get a go?&quot; everyone looks at them and someone will respond &quot;Where is your chip?&quot;; if it is in their hand then the answer is can be &quot;Now&quot; or &quot;soon&quot;, if it is in the bucket is is after the other characters have had some spotlight.<br /><br />And what do we mean by &quot;makes a move&quot;?  Well, it has to be something the player does - so &quot;take a powerful blow&quot; doesn&#39;t count but &quot;directly engage a threat&quot; would; however reacting to something, or defending/assisting another PC&#39;s move... well, that we leave up the GM and players to decide.  Our rule of thumb is that it has to be something big to use up your chip - and what is big?  Well, that is normally up to the GM to determine, and I normally go by if you have to role the dice then it is probably something big.<br /><br />It is not a perfect solution by a long shot, and I hope that after a while of playing we get more into the habit of sharing the spotlight but for now, it has removed the complaint of players feeling they didn&#39;t get enough action in a game session and everyone feels like they accumplished something in the game.<br /><br />What are some ideas other gaming groups have used to ensure that the spotlight is shared for players and GMs new PbtA type games?"

    "content": "Masks - GM Playbook (aka - GM Screens, aka - GM Cheat Sheets)<br /><br />During as a GM of Masks games I&#39;ve come across the issue of trying to keep everything I need at hand, when it was spread across 3 or 4 reference sheets and rules books.  I did investigate making a GM Screen, but I&#39;ve never been much good with those as the table we use is perpetually crowded (and/or small).  So, instead of a GM Screen I investigated a handheld Playbook format of the important things I needed to remember as GM.<br /><br />This then lead to some work cutting and pasting of the &quot;GM Reference Sheet&quot; and the &quot;Basic Moves&quot; sheet to create an 8 page GM Playbook that includes a list of all the items that I could possibly want (and a paragraph liberally borrowed from the Podcast: &quot;Nerds on a Roll&quot; - you should listen to it, it&#39;s great - that I read at the start of each session to remind the players what style of game we are playing as we only get one game in every couple of months). Now I just have these 2 Letter size pages, folded in half, with me all the time and I can reference just about anything I need without having to hide behind a screen.  I think this works better than a screen because the whole idea of Masks (and PbtA in general) is creative storytelling, and not an adversarial GM vs Players system... and I can still use this even lounging on the couch with the players in other comfy chairs. Hopefully it is helpful to other GMs.<br />",

(Feedback to that was positive) There was some great role play and some of the outstanding threads got wrapped up. In an 8 hour session, moves were triggered where dice were rolled only about 5 or 6 times. <br /><br />How do your experiences compare?"

    "content": "I&#39;d like to share a playbook idea I&#39;ve been mulling over for the last year or so. Maybe there&#39;s already something like it in Masks Unbound or Secrets of AEGIS. Discuss, comment, and help me flesh it out~<br /><br />= THE WOUNDED or THE SCARRED =<br /><br />// Concept<br />Once upon a time, you had everything; family and friends, luxury and wealth, and every other comfort you could name; life was perfect. But one day, tragedy struck, and something was lost. Now you&#39;re willing to sacrifice everything in a unending pursuit for vengeance.<br /><br />// Inspirations<br />Arsenal (Young Justice)<br />Robin (Teen Titans)<br />There are probably some Marvel heroes that fit into this concept as well. I&#39;d appreciate some pointers.<br /><br />// Playbook Feature - Comforts &amp; Scars/Wounds<br />In the playbook is a list of nice things, called Comforts. Such as: a good home, a romantic relationship, parents, hobbies. Even more abstract things, such as: health, wealth, and so on. By crossing these things out, and turning them into Scars, The Scarred can gain new abilities, new moves, and upgrades for their existing moves.<br /><br />For example, The Scarred&#39;s playbook moves would have a basic effect, and this effect would be stronger if they take a Scar to upgrade it. There would also be a list of generic Upgrades that would let them upgrade moves from other playbooks, or even select new abilities and moves.<br /><br />A final, big Scar is &#39;Future&#39;. If this Scar is taken, the current session may likely be The Scarred&#39;s last. They die, are no longer remembered by the world as a hero (or at all), sell their soul, or something equally terrible. Taking this Scar at the very least bars them from ever becoming another playbook, paragoning, or retiring.<br /><br />When and how they take Scars is something I haven&#39;t figured out yet. Perhaps they are forced to take one once per session? Or maybe it&#39;s totally up to them whenever they take a Scar. And if it&#39;s the latter, I wonder what interesting consequences might come with a Playbook that essentially has a self-destruct button.<br /><br />// Team Moves<br />The Scarred&#39;s Team Moves focus around rebuilding and healing. They can choose between a mechanical benefit; clearing Conditions or gaining Potential; or a narrative choice to heal/rebuild one of their Scars. Effectively giving them something back, but at the cost of losing an upgrade.<br /><br />// GM Moves<br />These are mostly focused around pushing and threatening Comforts. For example, pushing a comfort might be reminding The Scarred that they have very supportive and nice parents, and how wonderful and helpful it is to have people like that in their lives. Threatening a comfort might be reminding The Scarred that their parents could someday be in danger because of them, unless they cut ties, or that continuing to have a relationship with them hinders their mission. There may also be a move for tempting The Scarred to heal one of their Scars, effectively pushing them to &#39;undo&#39; their work and backtrack on their mission for vengeance.<br /><br />// In Summary<br />The Scarred can become a very powerful playbook/hero. They&#39;re excellent at what they do, and they could potentially fill any role in the Team. However, those who know them can easily see how all-consuming and self-destructive their mission is. There should be worry, calls for them to give up their life of superheroing or take a vacation from it, but no matter what, that underlying need for vengeance should permeate every aspect of their life, beckoning them to pursue an endless struggle against evil."

    "content": "Hey people! I have a few questions about the game.<br /><br />1) How do I introduce a new player character after the first session of play? I&#39;m asking this because I&#39;m not sure how this would affect the relations between the other characters.<br /><br />2) How do you handle the use of the &quot;comfort &amp; support&quot; move in your game? Last session my players kept using this move like healing potions and I felt that didn&#39;t have the emotional meaning that the move requires.<br /><br />3) how do you handle the &quot;power negation&quot; power from the delinquent playbook? I think this could be very overpower during the game.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks in advance. "

    "content": "How fast-paced are your games?<br /><br />One of my players has been complaining that my pace is too fast. My Halcyon City is constantly keeping them running around. My players are a Soldier, a Newborn, a Janus, and a Beacon. <br /><br />The beacon is a football player. The Quarterback, Liam Lyons, an NPC, dropped out of school to do super-hero stuff when he found out his dad was a super-villain (Dr Wrath), throwing the team in disarray. <br /><br />The Quarterback&#39;s older brother, former golden boy, Logan Lyons, is in college now. One of their classmates developed powers after attending a frat party. At first they thought it was because she was pregnant, but her gravity powers kicked in again after she had an abortion, tearing down the Planned Parenthood building with the Janus inside with her. <br /><br />The team stopped Seismic Prime from wrecking havoc, and stopped La Espada from robbing a bank during the distraction. Espada told them she was doing it to take care of her sister, who was sick due to super-related radiation. The team didn&#39;t believe that justified robbing banks and turned her in and reported her sister as being without a guardian. <br /><br />AEGIS took the little sister and gave her some of Dr. Wrath&#39;s syrum that turns normal people into powered individuals. This cured her disease, but granted her such rapid healing that one of the scientists at AEGIS went too far and cut off her hand - her hand grew back and the severed hand grew a new her. They cut the new clone in half, and both halves regenerated. <br /><br />La Espada opened a portal into the Beacon&#39;s bedroom and asked for his help breaking her sister out. He told her to suck it, she&#39;s a villain. She broke her sister(s) out and left them in his house while she went on the run. <br />Hearing her story, they started to trust AEGIS a little less. <br /><br />The Soldier&#39;s parents were out of town for a mission. Carbine swept in and introduced herself as Aunt Jessie. She was making inroads in gaining the soldier&#39;s trust by answering all his questions (whereas AEGIS proper told him things were classified above his clearance) and giving him whatever weapons or tools of death he wanted. She gave him access to files that showed his real parents were mutants killed by his adoptive AEGIS parents. <br /><br />The Lyons house got found out by AEGIS as Dr. Wrath&#39;s headquarters because of the team&#39;s social media. Dr. Wrath was captured. <br /><br />The soldier came clean to his adoptive parents while they were in the hospital after Dr. Wrath was abducted from AEGIS headquarters by Rampage, who wanted to force him to cure her. The team stopped Rampage. Also in that wing were the Gravity girl and the new quarterback who took Dr. Wrath&#39;s drug trying to be a better player, but instead developing a power that made everyone around him drunk. Worried about the scientist who would cut a girl in half and Carbine, then instructed the soldier to get his friends out and keep them safe. <br /><br />He put the girl who had just had an abortion on the lap of a horny football quarterback in a two-seater convertible. She started to have a panic attack, broke her AEGIS power-suppression collar and was about to explode the car. The Soldier broke the football jock&#39;s collar and quashed the explosion by making everyone in the block drunk - while driving. They managed to avoid destroying the city themselves, but only barely.<br /><br />When La Espada checked in with the Beacon to get her sister back (they had already hidden her with the Newborn&#39;s &quot;mom&quot; - a computer scientist who developed the AI that is the Newborn), he wouldn&#39;t tell her where the sister was, and got all preachy demanding she turn herself in for the bank robbery. So, she did, and told AEGIS that her sister had been at his house. When he came home from the football game, his parents and little brother were not there. He spent a few hours in a panic and thinking murderous thoughts about La Espada, assuming she had somehow portaled in and abducted his family to hold for ransom for her sister. Then when the AEGIS van pulled up to drop them off after hours of unsuccessful questioning, he started to feel like he should turn himself in, too. <br /><br />Beyond that, there&#39;s a subplot where someone is trying to make the cheerleaders and the football team think they&#39;re at war with one another. There&#39;s a C-storyline with anti-mutant legislation being lobied (the Janus&#39;s mom is one of the strongest supporters of this). "

    "content": "Buckle up, fans. The weekend&#39;s Masks RPG session was off-the-chain. Torq (The Nova) was unconscious, lost in his own psyche. His teammates would have to go into his mind to save him. Fortunately, Ed Zeppelin has a ship to lend them.<br /><br />Panic (The Doomed) was elected to take point on the rescue. Guess my new art for her came just in time! She would find Torq inside Torq&#39;s mind and convince him to come back. First, though, the team would have to sail through three layers of Torq&#39;s mental landscape.<br /><br />Captaining the ship was Ed Zeppelin&#39;s apprentice, special guest star Compass Rose (The Protégé). Rose warned the Salvatores to stay tethered to the ship, no matter what, as they sail it through Torq&#39;s perceptions, into his hopes, and finally into his darkest fears.<br /><br />And that&#39;s where General Bowmaster (The Beacon) was swept off the ship and came untethered. He encountered a grown-up, traumatized version of his friend Kevin, living as a survivalist in a dystopian Capstone City...ruled by Salvatores who went bad!<br /><br />The team ends up fighting their nightmare selves, of course. Sonia (The Soldier) tackles evil!Panic, then gets snagged and mind-controlled by evil!Sonia. Bowmaster faces down his dark self, a smooth, tuxedo-clad sniper.<br /><br />Halfpenny (The Transformed) empathizes with, then fights, his dark self, a blind brawler named Cent-urion with two penny eyepatches. Panic reaches Torq and risks her own doom to shake him from hopelessness.<br /><br />The darkness dissipates, the team regroups, and they all sail out of Torq into the real world. It was an epic, mind-bending start to Season Two of the Salvatores&#39; adventures!",

    "content": "So my players are gearing up for a massive Gala event that has all the makings of a heist/intrigue Issue. Two of my players have decided that to facilitate this heist they need fake identities. I suggested they play well known heroes and have worked on a Mechanic to make the stakes reasonable and not just about the RP. I&#39;d appreciate some thoughts on this mechanic.<br /><br />Alias: <br /><br />Suspicion: ❑  ❑ ❑ ❑ ❑<br /><br />You have an assumed identity. You must act in a manner which comports with your facade and failure to do so will raise suspicion. Whenever you fail to meet one of the assigned manners of your Alias, mark one on the Suspicion Track. <br /><br />Well Known but not Well Researched: You’ve studied your Alias prior to using them as a disguise. You’ve learned some of their various tics and mannerisms. Pick Two. <br /><br />Physical Ailment (Danger/Superior): Your Alias has suffered from a malady for some time. A debilitating virus, battle wounds from a fight with a rival or simply the march of time. Take -1 to Directly Engage or Assess the Situation while acting under your Alias. You may burn one Potential either on your track or earned in the scene to lower Suspicion while playing up your disability or ailment after a failed roll.<br /><br />Incompatible (Freak): Your powers and the powers of your Alias are wholly distinct from one another. You’ll need some fairly good bluffing to make the square peg fit the round hole. Take -1 to Unleashing your Powers while acting under your Alias. You may burn one Potential either on your track or earned in the scene to lower Suspicion by solving a problem without your abilities. <br /><br />Callous (Savior/Mundane): Your Alias is not known for their good reputation. Perhaps they’re a villain who wantonly disposes of their minions. Perhaps you’re a hero that punished harshly and praises rarely. Either way, you’re not the sort to stand up in defense of anyone or anything but yourself and your cause and everyone knows it. Take either -1 to Defend or Comfort/Support while acting under your Alias. You may burn one Potential either on your track or earned in the scene to lower Suspicion by rejecting or otherwise acting harshly to a teammate or someone you have Influence over outside your Alias.<br /><br />Burned Bridges (Superior): The person you are emulating is either not respected, feared or otherwise an outsider to the wider hero community. Your words carry little weight with your peers. Take -1 to Provoke while acting under your Alias. You may burn one Potential either on your track or earned in the scene to lower Suspicion by further acting in a manner that would make your peers ostracize you.<br /><br />Detached (Mundane): Your Alias, for whatever reason, is well known for their public persona at the expense of their more private reservations and feelings thus making it difficult to relate to others. Take -1 to Pierce the Mask rolls while acting under your Alias. You may burn one Potential either on your track or earned in the scene to lower Suspicion by actively opening up to someone you’ve spurned in the past.<br /><br />Center of Attention: You’ve picked a popular or famous Alias and the world, regardless of why, has expectations and exceeding Influence over you. Take -1 to rejecting the Influence while acting under your Alias. At any time you may declare you are using your status to distract or place yourself at the forefront of the scene. Roll + Suspicion. On a miss, you may lower your Suspicion by 1 to a minimum of 0. On a hit you’ve got their attention, take +1 forward to your next action but increase your Suspicion by 1. On a 10+, you’ve misstepped, your enemies gain an opportunity and increase your Suspicion by 1. You may burn one Potential either on your track or earned in the scene to lower Suspicion by playing to your beloved status when it is least appropriate. <br /><br /><br />In the Moment: Any time, until your cover is blown, you may expend a single Suspicion to use an Adult Move associated with your choices from Well Known but not Well Researched. You may use this once per scene.<br /><br />Facade: Maintaining an Alias is difficult. At the end of the scene or when time passes, roll + Suspicion to see how well you are keeping up your ruse. On a miss, you’ve kept your ruse up and no one seems to suspect a thing. On a hit, you’ve bungled some important detail. What is it? Take an additional -1 to a single Well Known but not Well Researched choices until the end of the following scene. On a 10+, someone knows and they’re bound to sound the alarm. Indicate one person in the scene and say how they know.<br /><br />If masquerading as an Adult persona, you are considered to have Influence over teenage heroes. If they reject that Influence, instead of removing your or your Aliases Influence over them gain 1 Suspicion instead. Once all five Suspicion points have been marked, your cover is blown. Mark a Condition and prepare for the worst. <br />"

    "content": "Some shifts in our game have required fun custom move creation. I play a Bull turned Soldier. In our 5th session, we learned that the Forge (the group that made Sonia the Bull) had implanted mind control triggers. <br /><br />In between session 6 and 7, the GM gave me a love letter where Sonia got help learning to the resist the mind control. So I wrote (consulting with the GM) this custom move for future interactions:<br /><br />When you <b>resist mind control using your mantra</b>, roll + Conditions. If you have influence over the person trying to control you, take -1.<br /><br />On a 10+, choose one:<br /><br />* You do exactly what the command entails, and there’s a momentum to the mind control, you do the next thing they ask, too. No roll allowed.<br />* The only way to avoid letting them use your powers is to use them first! Lose control of your powers in a terrible way and mark an appropriate condition.<br />* Choose two options from the 7-9 list.<br /><br />On a 7-9, choose one:<br /><br />* You successfully resist the command, but it takes constant effort. Take -1 ongoing to all rolls, until the end of the scene or until the command is released<br />* You meditate, hard, and hold on until the command dissipates. But your enemy isn’t waiting for you to clear your head. You give ground, your opposition gets an opportunity.<br />* You resist the command, but you’re emotionally staggered. Mark a condition, and your opponent gets to ask you a question you must answer honestly.<br /><br />On a miss, you hold strong and the command doesn’t seem to affect you, for now. Mark potential and the GM will tell you what the command appeared to be trying to do. Maybe take influence over the person who tried to control you, GM&#39;s call.<br /><br />But by session 8, the Forge had taken a hostage and forced Sonia to come back into their fold. She was gradually won over to their mission (if not their methods) and made a playbook shift to Soldier at the end of session 12.<br /><br />That meant I wanted a way for her to work with mind control, instead of always resisting it. So, for session 15, I worked with the GM and debuted this:<br /><br />When you <b>cooperate with a Forge trigger</b>, roll +Soldier.<br /><br />On a hit it&#39;s just like in training.<br /><br />* You understand the command and blend with it, take +1 ongoing while in the grip of the mind control.<br />O<br />n a 7–9, add a complication:<br /><br />* Once the command has you, you can see there was a catch. Mark a condition to resist, or else put an ally in danger.<br />* You carry out the command, but the transition into or out of mind control leaves you disoriented. Someone (GM&#39;s choice) can ask a pierce the mask question that you must answer honestly.<br />* Shift Soldier up and Savior down.<br /><br />On a 6-<br /><br />* You get more than you bargained for, and you can&#39;t hold it back. The GM will tell you if this also means you mark a condition."

It also changed her powers—which came in handy when she had to fight her own brother, who was also under the Rime Court&#39;s thumb.<br /><br />Halfpenny (The Transformed) raided Quartermaster&#39;s cache, then was yanked by Rime Court chains to a rooftop, where he managed to get free and then depower the Invictus-affected kids being used to trap the adult heroes, the Crimebusters, in their base.<br /><br />Captain Bowmaster (The Beacon) had a huge day: commanding F.A.T.E. soldiers, taking over a Rime Court ballista to shut down the last portal, convincing Doc Quantum to make him a deputy Crimebuster, and even upgrading his codename (he&#39;s still deciding between Colonel and General Bowmaster).<br /><br />In the end, the city was saved—though there were hints the Rime Court has something sneakier brewing.

Highlights - since the Scarlet Songbird (SS) is an older guy trying to reclaim his super villain status of bygone years I described as looking like Stan Lee from the Marvel cameo appearances. Torn, our Transformed (looks like Swampthing) created a crater in the floor trying to punch SS. SS cried out &quot;Tally Ho&quot; and flipped up onto Thorn shoulders... then flipped over to put his back to the teller partisan. Shadow Wing (Legacy) flew at him with the intent of ramming him. SS vaulted over her by using a hand on her head. &quot;Have at thee, knave!!&quot; Shadow Wing slammed her head in the partisan... up to her neck. SS (and some of the banking staff) was laughing pretty hard at all this. Torn smashed SS&#39;s lute and wrapped him up with a network of vines extending from his hands and fingers. Police arrived and took SS into custody. SS parting comment, &quot;I say, Jolly good time. We will have to do it again.&quot;<br /><br />I need to master move of my GM moves and get my agenda glued into my brain. Further adventures will get better.<br />"

We play with rotating players and GMs, target diversity as one of our greatest goals, and try to make listening feel like picking up a single run that intersects with other ongoing comics.<br /><br />There are 61 episodes, but don&#39;t let that intimidate you!  When new characters are introduced we have a brief 5-10 minute episode that explains who they are, gives a little backstory, and shows some of their mechanics.  This allows us to have them jump onto the page when the actual game starts and feel like they have existed in their own comic run!<br /><br />If you&#39;re listening from the beginning, I strongly recommend listening to those character introductions, but feel free to skip worldbuilding.  It&#39;s pretty long and honestly just not required reading, but more intended for people who love Protean City and want to know more of the world!",

But then try to get the older heroes out of the way so they don’t get all the spotlight. <br /><br />Building up to a fight, especially as in a one-shot I try to use important villains from the hero’s backstory / extras etc. “They just show up and attack” seems a bit anti-climactic if they’re a big deal. <br /><br />Lean hard on things like the beacon’s drives when looking for things to introduce into the fiction. If it’s something the player picked they want to see it do, since we’re only playing once, why not include it. <br /><br />Do you have other ideas about this?<br /><br />"

Norma Conquest swore fealty to the director (missing her old lord, William the Conqueror) and was commended for her swashbuckling by film star Errol Loxley (grandfather to our usual campaign&#39;s Beacon).<br /><br />Behind the whole scheme... Jeanne (Jenny) Blague, an intern who was trying to defend the director&#39;s existentialist vision. The Hurricane took her down with lightning, defusing the immediate threat.<br /><br />But when the director admitted he wasn&#39;t even French, and he didn&#39;t care too much about his vision, just about seeming deep, Jeanne stormed off the set, saying it looked like all anyone cared about was cheap laughs.... the origin story of Commediennemy (who we&#39;ve fought in our usual campaign).",

He chooses to create an opportunity for a teammate, and to resist or avoid their blows.<br /><br />The GM narrates the fiction, then announces that &quot;the way villains work is, as soon as you hit them, they get to make a move.&quot;  He then proceeds to make a move (not sure which one) and has another villain join the fray.<br /><br />The part that I&#39;m confused about is the part I put in quotes.  That&#39;s not the way Dungeon World (which I&#39;m much more famililar with) works, and I can&#39;t locate where in the rules it is stated or implied that this is how Masks works.  It seems really strange to me.  <br /><br />Is the quoted inerpretation accurate, or is it just a matter of a GM getting a rule wrong in the first session of a game he may not have run before?  If it is correct, could someone give me a page number to study?  (Or if it&#39;s wrong, just out of curiousity, does anyone who listens to the podcast know if the GM starts getting it right in later episodes?)"

    "content": "I need help figuring out a villain&#39;s powers. In my campaign the PCs are going up against a government super-soldier conspiracy called Project Aladdin, and they went to talk to a super-soldier who defected from them (and was in the hospital after a fight with these same PCs, long story) when two superpowered government agents showed up to silence the defector. I find I run best when I make things up as I go, so I hadn&#39;t really planned the agents out in advance, but once the fight started I went with my gut and had one of the agents draw a sword out of nowhere, deciding on the spot that his power was to summon weapons. Our session ended before the second one could show their power.<br /><br />One of the players had been looking through a random superhero name generator and reading off a bunch of silly names, among which were Giant Katana and Heart Stealer. And when I had the first agent summon his sword, the players got very excited about the idea that those were the two agents. I&#39;m not using those for their actual codenames, but since it excited my players I want to embrace the idea. Obviously the sword-summoning guy is Giant Katana, so the one who has yet to show his power is Heart Stealer.<br /><br />The first possible power that comes to mind for Heart Stealer is some kind of mind control, but I find mind-controlling villains are a pain to run. The second possibility is some kind of psychic surgery, where he can remove, insert or rearrange things inside a target&#39;s body just by touching them, for example literally stealing someone&#39;s heart. It&#39;s a cool power, and fitting for a government assassin, but with something like that I don&#39;t know how to keep him from just instantly killing any PC he lands a hit on. So I need to either find a way to nerf that, or come up with a different power for him. Any suggestions?"

Some highlights:<br /><br />*Brendan Conway is delightful in person, and listened appreciatively to us telling him about our home campaign (particularly the Time Sloth).<br /><br />*In a session I GM&#39;d, the Delinquent pretended he was too cool to use the silly name the others had come up for the their team, the Galactic Acrobatic Ranch-hands (GAR). At the very end of the session, in a gesture of good will, he pulled back his sleeve and showed the Legacy the GAR tattoo he&#39;d gotten.<br /><br />*In a session I played, I got to try out the Star playbook with Sam Seraph, a streaming sensation with six unearthly purple wings. Sam was (briefly) arrested by AEGIS at the conclusion of the mission, and was gagged for mouthing off. This radicalized him against AEGIS, so in my end-of-session scene I narrated Sam addressing his audience about the need to overthrow AEGIS&#39;s fascist regime, and hawking half-face masks styled after his gag and branded with his purple wing insignia.<br /><br />*In another session I GM&#39;d, the Transformed rolled a miss on Pierce the Mask while trying to literally break a villain&#39;s mask. I said, &quot;Yes, you break open the mask, but what you see is someone gaunt and pale like you, clearly someone who underwent the same transformation. He fixes you with a look of deep betrayal.

    "content": "I just posted this to Reddit to show that you can justify enhanced mobility for all playbooks (at least from the core book), and I thought I&#39;d share it here too:<br /><br />The Beacon has trick arrows (grappling hooks! Swinglines!) and phasing (air-walking, like Kitty Pride) and acrobatics (parkour) and stealth (just appearing out of the shadows at an impossible location, like Batman).<br /><br />The Bull is a Hulk-like wrecking ball. Part of their deal is that their powers are a bit limited in focus - they wreck stuff and take hits. You can expand that a bit by allowing Hulk-like leaping, or you get creative. Gotta get up on that rooftop? Climb the wall with your super-strength, possibly while carrying another hero. Or after throwing them up there ahead of you.<br /><br />The Delinquent has teleportation and gadgets (which can include mobility-enhancers like wall-crawling boots or hover boards).<br /><br />The Doomed has telekinesis and psychic constructs and can lift themselves and others, either through levitation or summoning force bubbles or platforms like Sue Richards. They also have superhuman speed, so they can just come running into a scene like the Flash or a vampire (what with the recent trend of super-speed for them on screen).<br /><br />The Janus has impossible mobility, so you can do Spider-Man style super-leaping and web-swinging, jump across whole city blocks like the Hulk, or ride the winds or travel along power lines or through substances they mimic or through the psychic mindscape of the animals they control.<br /><br />The Legacy has outright flight, but also super-speed, Batman-esque gadgetry, magic weapons (toss that magic hammer without letting go) and shadow portals. Mobility isn&#39;t an issue for them.<br /><br />All of the Nova&#39;s ability options provide access to flight or other mobility options. Levitation, gravity warping, spells of flight and mystic portals, letting the winds carry you or rocketing along like the Human Torch, growing wings with your biokinesis, riding your sweet cosmic surfboard or just folding space so that you can take a single step to the other side of the world.<br /><br />The Outsider can fly even before choosing their ability package. The details are up to you - do you psychically levitate? Do you have anti-grav boots? An alien jetpack? Do you shapeshift into a winged leviathan and have your friends ride on your back? Or do you all zip along in your strange alien vessel?<br /><br />The Protégé has access to gadgets (grappling hooks, personal teleporters, web shooters), stealth (&quot;I am right behind you!&quot;), body elasticity (Reed Richards can form his limbs into swinglines and or float by flattening out his body), telekinesis (levitation), and elemental control (ride the winds, grab on to a bolt of lightning you summoned, blast off like a rocket, or summon a pillar of water to lift you up, etc).<br /><br />The Transformed has inhuman might, so Hulk leap logic applies. They have plant affinity, so they can grow themselves a new plant-like body at their target location if there&#39;s any plant life there, like Swamp Thing.<br />"

I&#39;m thinking of examples like Ben Ten, the Jaime Reyes Blue Beetle, a young Green Lantern. The central conflict for the playbook would be about the young hero dealing with the artifact&#39;s arcane expectations or different ideas of heroism. Playbook name might be The Recruit.<br /><br />What do people think? Do you have other examples of characters in this wheelhouse? What sort of moves and abilities would make sense in a custom playbook like this?<br /><br />"

For the past six months, Denino had been struggling with fans over his girlfriend, a platinum-blond streamer named Caroline. Viewers thought that she was taking him away from the stream and using him to boost her own career; they called her “the leech.” They bombarded the subreddit with hateful posts about Caroline and Denino, approached the couple in real life to harass them, and staged a boycott that cut Denino’s viewership and revenue by a third, demanding that he break up with her. Denino resisted for months—Caroline made him happy—but eventually he relented. “It just got too much, dude,” he told me. “It was just easier to break up with her than to deal with it.” He showed me a chart of his earnings, which had doubled the week after he and Caroline broke up.&quot;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/07/09/ice-poseidons-lucrative-stressful-life-as-a-live-streamer\" class=\"ot-anchor\">https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/07/09/ice-poseidons-lucrative-stressful-life-as-a-live-streamer</a>",

    "content": "At a recent Masks session, my sister guest-starred as a Legacy. She was the child of adult heroes that had already been introduced in the campaign, and their powerset didn&#39;t match one of those listed for the Legacy. So we took her parents&#39; powers (weather control) and created a track of abilities for them:<br /><br />*Temperature control<br />*Precipitation control<br />*Wind control<br />*Lightning control<br />*Flight<br /><br />This worked well. She picked Temperature control, wind control, and flight. Which are pretty cool on their own! But the lack of lightning and rain, snow, hail etc. also gave the sense she had room to grow into her heroic mantle. It&#39;s cool to break down a classic powerset into a suite from which the Legacy has to choose what they can do already and what they aspire to get to do."

The story has been rewritten a little to fit in with contemporary society and more mature expectations, and that has moved Tyrone and Tandy away from the playbooks we might typically associate them with. <br /><br />In the show, Tandy feels like &quot;the Reformed&quot;. She has a past life she can call on (more than one actually), and specializes in calling people out on their shit. She could also swing a Delinquent pretty clearly.<br /><br />While you could call him a Janus, to me Tyrone is acting a lot more like a Legacy. This is interesting to me, because it brings the family questions down to a much more human level. "

The Salvatores had been tasked by her dad with watching out for her.

Halfpenny (The Protégé) leapt into the fray and bonded with Kid Cyclone. Torque (The Outsider) developed and wielded a new power, turning into fire, so as to fight a Rogue Wave&#39;s backup...<br /><br />...a horned hunter of the Rime Court! Sonia (The Bull), confronting what the Forge had always meant for her to fight, discovered the iron knuckles built into her arms and embraced being a Soldier of the Forge. (Our first playbook change, from Bull to Soldier.)<br /><br />Captain Bowmaster (The Beacon) made a choice just as major. After defying and defeating Rogue Wave, who said he didn&#39;t belong in the superhero world, he encountered his mom, Assistant District Attorney Evelyn Loxley—and revealed his secret identity to her!<br /><br />The team all agreed that Kid Cyclone had upheld her family&#39;s heroic legacy, and her parents agreed! She leveraged their happiness to make a play for a getting a dog. But not just any dog: Thunderbolt, the Lightning Dog!",

    "content": "Had my session 1 GMing masks this weekend. <br /><br />My team: Tsunami<br />Loto Manuia / The Duke (Beacon)  - Big Hawaiian football offensive lineman who is friends with everyone.<br />&quot;Kelly&quot; Min Sun Yoon / Blink (Janus) - Korean girl with anti-mutant tiger-mom who has x-rary vision, superhearing, and can teleport short distances.<br />Jo Nakamura /Samurai (Soldier) - Japanese genderfluid AEGIS foster, being raised by the Smiths<br />Yuliu &quot;Jane&quot; Chu / Lightshow (Newborn) - AI/Android living with the woman who created the AI, has solid light manipulation powers. <br /><br />Started off with the Smiths informing Jo over breakfast that they were going to be away on assignment, not sure how long. When Jo got home from school, &quot;Auntie Jessie&quot; was there. She was super-cool, and gave Jo access to all kinds of AEGIS stuff, weapons, technology, and information, that the official channels had been denying. <br />She gave orders to find out more about the girl at school who just developed powers and determine how to proceed. It took a while before the Smiths got the text Jo sent asking them about Auntie Jessica and responded with &quot;WHO?&quot; When the AEGIS agents suspected Carbine was in their house, we ended with a cliffhanger scene for Jo as the Smiths texted &quot;GET OUT NOW!&quot;<br /><br />Liam Lyans, the school&#39;s most popular boy, football quarterback, Student Council president, etc., is screwing up everything. He fails a math test and his GPA drops so low that he&#39;s off the team and prohibited from participating in any extracurricular activities. Cheerleader Willa Weston can&#39;t date someone who&#39;s not on the football team, so she publicly breaks up with him. She immediately marches up to Loto and declares &quot;It appears I need a date for Homecoming.&quot; He strong-arms her. &quot;That&#39;s my boy, Liam, I gotta have his back. Good luck getting a date.&quot; She&#39;s furious and humiliated by this and declares him blacklisted.<br /><br />Jane, being an AI, had no trouble scoring 100% on her math test, but on the custom move, she rolled a 6, so that meant that Christy Price cheated off her test - badly - and also scored 100%. They were both called to remain after class and explain. Jane had no idea what was going on. Christy tried to throw her under the bus, but it backfired. As punishment, because the world isn&#39;t fair, Jane was forced to tutor Christy (and Liam, as it turned out). She was made from educational software, originally, so she&#39;s really good at it, but the students she&#39;s working with are difficult. <br /><br />Jane found an angsty love-note in her locker. She didn&#39;t try to figure out who wrote it or show it to anyone except her mom. She did prevent the school bully from picking on the class butt-monkey, and got him to hospitalize himself trying to kick her ass. He punched where her face had been, hit the wall instead, then cracked his nose trying to headbutt her. Her guess is that the note might be from the kid she helped, but the line about not knowing he exists confuses her. <br /><br />During Social Studies, Jennifer Stone cries out and suddenly everyone and everything in the class is pushed away from her and pinned to the walls and windows (which are cracking). Loto tries to fight his way toward her - this is what offensive lineman do, after all. Plus he has experience withstanding Hawaii waves. Kelly is pinned against the window. She could teleport and be fine, but that would expose her, so she simply pushes against the gravity and climbs off the window, helping other kids off in the most mundane way, saving them just before Jennifer&#39;s powers lash out again flinging Loto to the ceiling and exploding the windows. The team take turns getting their friends safe and trying to comfort and support Jennifer, calming her enough to stop her power flare. Most of the class is rushed off to the nurse. Loto volunteers to stay with Jennifer (bringing her with the crowd could be bad). She dismisses him and asks Kelly to talk, saying she&#39;s not sure the power came from her, and asking the girl to go with her to a health clinic.<br /><br />Kelly&#39;s parents find out she skipped the last few classes to go to Planned Parenthood, and subject her to an awkward discussion about sex, STDs. She&#39;s grounded, and forced to back goodies for her mom to give out at her anti-mutant hate-group meetings. She considers mischief, but doesn&#39;t want anything that could be traced back to her, so no laxatives in the brownies. <br /><br />They try to support Liam and help him get over whatever&#39;s making him spiral, and discover that he&#39;s Wildcat, sidekick to the White Lion (his older brother Logan, the perfect all-American boy he&#39;s trying to live up to). He&#39;s come to the conclusion that his after-school hero activities are more important than math tests, football, or Willa because he found something. He leads Tsunami to his own house under which is the lair of what looks like Dr. Wrath. His dad might just be a notorious supervillain. What is he supposed to do with that? <br /><br />The team tried to follow-up on La Espada at AEGIS HQ. Agents were keen to get their report on Dr. Wrath&#39;s lair and what they found there, but blew off their questions about seeing Daniela Santana or her sister. They insisted it was being taken care of. Loto wrote a note that they assured him they would get to Daniela to tell her that her sick sister was being taken care of. He didn&#39;t leave with a feeling that she would actually get it. <br />Loto&#39;s final scene for the night was waking up to a light in his bedroom from a portal La Espada cut through reality. She looked at him and asked, &quot;You ready to help me fix what you screwed up?&quot;"

We decorated for the &quot;Arctic Bliss&quot; theme, made a playlist of high school dance classics, and then had our teen superhero characters attend Homecoming. What could go wrong?<br /><br />While the others picked out their outfits, Torque (The Outsider) was busy faking his death. Panic (The Delinquent) saw his robot body turned into paper clips by his alien overseers. It was tragic! But...<br /><br />...he showed up at Homecoming in his new, much-more-human body. Hooray!<br />Of course it turned out his powers had transferred too, and were much more unstable, which we discovered when he accidentally reversed gravity. Oops. (Playbook change: Outsider —&gt; Nova)<br /><br />Sonia (The Soldier) was asked to the dance by Kevin, and, suspiciously, her Forge handlers gave her permission to go. Furnace turned up and they had a heart-to-heart, and even shared a brief kiss. But it turns out the Forge somehow got a tracker on Furnace!<br /><br />Captain Bowmaster (The Beacon) had a full night: dealing with his mom chaperoning, flirting/fighting with Red Cent and Katya (who may or may not be the same person...). Oh, and he was crowned Homecoming Prince!<br /><br />Halfpenny (The Protégé) struck out with his date, Katya, by dropping her on a dip.<br />In response to a crisis at the dance (punch spiked with superpower drug Invictus) he took drastic action: ingesting some Invictus and the Bad Penny, he transformed into a monstrous new form! (Playbook change: Protégé to Transformed)<br /><br />The day was saved, but the ramifications of the Salvatores&#39; actions are bound to be major. But no one can deny this was a Homecoming night to remember!",

For example, Influence is an issue, since the cast will be changing a bit each session, probably.

    "content": "I ran my second session of a campaign today, the heroes fought three teenaged villains in a supermarket. After hearing a bit about the villains&#39; motivations, Sirius the Janus decided to let them go with a warning (without consulting the rest of the team). After a night of comforting, supporting and making bad decisions to clear conditions, Titan the Bull found out that one of the villains, Speed Demon, was his roommate at Halcyon Academy (the boarding school that they all go to). He and Sorceress the Nova revealed to the Speed Demon that they were the heroes he fought earlier, and then Mirror the Protege found out about that and promptly reported him to her mentor and the police. Speed Demon got arrested, and the heroes spent the rest of the session arguing (in character) over whether they did the right thing by reporting him. Sirius and Mirror think they did right, while Titan and Sorceress wanted to help him redeem himself instead of sending him to jail, and De Mise the Delinquent refused to take a side. Oh, and Speed Demon&#39;s two partners, Rockbreaker and Miss Fortune, are also students at Halcyon Academy and are still at large.<br /><br />(To clarify, Halcyon Academy is just a normal boarding school, not a school for superheroes. Though the players do have some leeway because Mirror&#39;s mentor, Solar Flare, is a teacher there in his secret identity.)<br /><br />While they were arguing, one of my players turned to me and said &quot;darn it Seb, your game is giving me feelings,&quot; which I think is about the highest praise I&#39;ve ever received as a GM."

    "content": "Last night&#39;s Masks RPG was a wild ride. Panic (The Delinquent) reached out to her creepy doppelgänger to establish a new rapport. It kind of worked? The doppelgänger acquired the name Sapphire.<br /><br />Sonia (The Bull) returned to Capstone City by riding inside of a giant Darkhavian golem-spider, launched from Castle Devastation like a rocket. She then investigated an abandoned theater and took a beating at the hands of vengeful Vaudvillains with a new paint-spattered look.<br /><br />Torque (The Outsider) hearing Sonia&#39;s distress call, invoked his Moment of Truth: a fleet of ships from his homeworld arrived to defeat the spider and its spiderlings, impressing the Crimebuster Legendaria and helping Torque <b>finally</b> acquire the Time Sloth for his people.<br /><br />By the time Torque brought his fleet into the theater, the others had overawed the Vaudvillains and knocked out their leader, the speedy Spatterdash. Halfpenny (The Protégé) tripped the artsy villain up with a barrage of pennies from heaven, and then handed her over to F.A.T.E.",

    "content": "<br />Our two-part Masks RPG adventure ended with a bang. Trying to escape the dungeons of Darkhavia, Captain Bowmaster (The Beacon) fought/kissed the supervillainess Red Cent and rescued his dad, Bart Loxley—without his mask, so Bart has questions.<br /><br />Sonia (The Bull) showed up to help with Bowmaster, but declined rescue herself. She wants to learn to wield her powers with the Forge. She did put her fiery fists in Catapoltergeist&#39;s ghostly face!<br /><br />Halfpenny (The Protégé) recruited a swarm of giant bats to help the team. And, when Baron Devastation appeared, Halfpenny dared to shed the blood of the rightful ruler of Darkhavia with a razor quarter, and then tried to make peace by comforting him.<br /><br />Panic (The Delinquent) directly engaged a threat for the first time, calling on her crystal ring to attack Devastation with solid illusion doppelgängers. Her shadowy patron, Mr. Hunt, then appeared, and Devastation flung the team away.<br /><br />As the team left, the castle was shaking from the confrontation between Devastation and Hunt. Torque (The Outsider) had enough, and developed a new alien power in order to crush the ring to dust in his hand. The Salvatores (sans Sonia) return home, with many lingering questions.",

    "content": "So how did Masks go last night? Well, the whole team present got arrested by F.A.T.E. (the Federal Agency for Tackling the Extranormal). Fortunately, Torque (The Outsider) knows a good lawyer, the well-travelled Peter Kristofferson.<br /><br />The feral scrapper Porpentine ran amok in the F.A.T.E. base, and Halfpenny (The Protégé) led the team to take him down. He got through the fight with no conditions, but praise from his villainous side mentor Quartermaster left him angry and guilty.<br /><br />Panic (The Delinquent) was the team&#39;s emotional center this week, dealing with her own emotional wreckage from the last adventure, but also comforting Halfpenny and Torque. Plus, she sparred with her worried guardian, Uncle Cas. [Check out Claire&#39;s emo Panic cosplay!]<br /><br />Oh, and in the end, Halfpenny went to therapy with Lady Hurricane, a retired superhero and psychiatric specialist in trauma related to superheroics. He unlocked the power of empathy!",

When a character takes the &quot;change playbooks&quot; advance, I know they&#39;re supposed to transfer all their advances below the line. <br /><br />Are they allowed to, then, keep taking advances below the line, or do they need to take five above-line advances on their new playbook first? <br /><br />EDIT: For an example: If I switch playbooks, can I take an adult move immediately (since I&#39;ve already unlocked &quot;below the line advances&quot;), or do I need to take five advances in the new playbook first?<br /><br />The corebook says, &quot;Use the advancement track on your new playbook, but transfer any marks you’ve made below the line—those advances don’t &#39;refresh&#39; when you change playbooks,&quot; which doesn&#39;t seem to point to an answer either way. <br /><br />I can see an argument in favor of either, and nothing seems obvious or natural. I asked my GM, and he suggested that I check in with you all. "

    "content": "Here is a love letter I wrote for a player (Sonia, the Bull) who was checking into a F.A.T.E. facility to see if they can help her build safeguards against her mental programming from the sinister organization that gave her powers. F.A.T.E. is the equivalent organization in our universe to S.H.I.E.L.D. or A.E.G.I.S.<br /><i>___</i><br /><br />Dear Sonia,<br /><br />Time to meet F.A.T.E. Hope you survive the experience.<br /><br />Agent Kimura—close-cropped hair, businesslike, familiar from the Titanfall Meadow adventure—escorts you to a F.A.T.E. facility nicknamed “The Dorm.” It’s housed in an old Art Deco train station that looks something like this (<a href=\"https://media.cntraveler.com/photos/54e76199560f0bf2218e5c35/master/w_820,c_limit/9-cincinatti-courtesy-cincinatti-museum-central.jpg\" class=\"ot-anchor\">https://media.cntraveler.com/photos/54e76199560f0bf2218e5c35/master/w_820,c_limit/9-cincinatti-courtesy-cincinatti-museum-central.jpg</a>). As far as the public knows, the building has been repurposed as a boring postal service processing and distribution center, but that’s just a front. This place houses battalions of F.A.T.E. agents, as well as superpowered individuals who’ve entered F.A.T.E. custody for special observation, training, or their own protection.<br /><br />Para-militarism, macho posturing, grim humor—some parts of this remind you of the gang back in Central America. The bureaucracy here is less familiar, and more grating. Seems like you can indeed sign out, but you have to give the support staff on duty a reason for leaving and an ETR. “Just to get some fucking space” doesn’t count as a reason, but the Salvatores do. You wonder if that’s just because the team made a very public debut and is having a moment in both the news cycle and in celebrity coverage (mostly speculation about whether Adonis is dating any of you). Could they be waiting to “disappear” you till your team is out of the limelight?<br /><br />You’re assigned a bottom bunk in a barracks. You eat in a mess hall with a large swath of Dorm occupants. You have sessions on alternating days with scientists and psychics investigating the Forge programming. And yes, in those sessions, there’s a rookie F.A.T.E. trainee standing by with a fire extinguisher in case things go badly. Outside of that, you have access to training rooms like the pool, the gym, and a special room for testing heavy weaponry where you can specifically practice your powers.<br /><br />How well is life going for you here? Let’s find out. You’re here to pave the way for Aislin to be deprogrammed more safely and swiftly. You think of your time here as a sacrifice. Role +Savior, that is, +1.<br /><br />On 10+, choose two perks and one complication.<br /><br />On a 7–9, choose two perks and two complications.<br /><br />On a Miss, mark potential, choose one perk, and two complications.<br /><br />Perks:<br /><br />*You bond with and/or find sympathy from a F.A.T.E. overseer. Tell us about him/her, including name, rank, and why he or she is invested in Sonia.<br /><br />*With help from F.A.T.E. scientists and psychics, you develop a mantra that should (hypothetically) give you some protection against Forge trigger words. What is the mantra? What’s one of its limitations?<br /><br />*F.A.T.E. considers it it’s job to keep tabs on all extranormal phenomena: heroes, villains, unaligned supers, etc. By chatting up F.A.T.E. personnel, you learn something about another character Sonia has encountered. What do you learn? Take +1 forward against that character.<br /><br />Complications:<br /><br />*You manage to antagonize one of the scientists or psychics working with you. Tell us who, how, and in what petty payback they take.<br /><br />*During one of your deprogramming sessions, a traumatic flashback reveals some new memory of time with the Forge. Tell us about the memory (which may still be a bit scattered and uncertain). Mark an appropriate condition.<br /><br />*F.A.T.E. gives you an onerous rule or restriction that you must abide by. This could be a subdermal chip, or could be more of a behavioral restriction. What is it?<br /><br />Whew! A F.A.T.E.-full time at The Dorm. Godspeed, Sonia. <br /><br />Off, off to adventure,<br />Your Gamemaster"

    "content": "Alpine Academy Session 5-6<br /><br />Session 5<br />Cross&#39; villain, a religious fanatic named Crusader, captured Cross (because the player was late) in a church on Sunday. He also captured Lotus, who is Serena&#39;s older sister. Fiona uses her fear-based powers to crowd control most of the room, but a battle still breaks out. Cross is freed and helps everyone escape. It turns out Crusader is working with a mysterious Dark Angel named Apostate who has similar powers to Cross. However, while Cross uses healing magic...Apostate causes psychological harm which dampens powers (ie: the hopeless condition). His powers have no effect on Fiona however because she is already dark in nature as the Doomed. Specter, the ghost-mutant is the main one to confront the Angel. Having lost his powers, he is forced to punch at the new villain. His hands are bloody in the aftermath and the Angel escapes after a sword clash with Cross. Crusader is detained by the group and the media arrives, finding the group for the first time. Specter gets frustrated, assaulting the media and leaving. The group doesn&#39;t really make a strong showing, but they did save civilians from being hurt in the collateral damage (even though the religious zealots all hate and fear them.)<br /><br />Scene 1<br />Cyerna is in class asleep (because her player was busy moving). The rest of the class does some combat drills to establish what their combat styles are like. Ignition uses dirty fighting and small objects like nails. Fiona mostly avoids combat by dancing around it. Specter fights basically by using boxing, weaving, and punching and hitting soft spots.<br /><br />Scene 2<br />Madame Butterfly (one of the teachers in the school) comes into the room and asks them to check on Cyerna.<br /><br />Butterfly makes several announcements to the students about current events. All electronics are going to be monitored due to a security breach which may include a virus. <br /><br />Lotus, Cyrena&#39;s sister, an independent hero with plant powers, has been hired as a full-time teacher to keep her close and teach about local plants/wildlife.<br /><br />Specter and Fiona get called into the office because they appeared on TV in the last session. Specter punched a cameraman, so Butterfly urges him to keep a low profile. At least he was wearing a mask, Fiona&#39;s face had to be blurred in the broadcast to protect her identity<br /><br />Scene 3<br />It turns out Cyerna isn&#39;t waking up so Cross (an Angel PC) uses healing power to wake her up. They realize some magic influence is affecting her and bring in Ninfu to investigate. Ninfu gets a 2 on the dice, so she ends up getting possessed by an unknown entity and going insane. <br /><br />She lashes out against the students and Cross fails to capture her. She makes it outside of the school, but Ignition is able to restrain her. Butterfly uses her power to produce sleep gas and Ninfu is detained. The teachers are worried the magical influence is contagious so she sends the students away.<br /><br />Scene 4<br />After dealing with Ninfu, ignition goes to her black market dealer for help with this magic problem. She gets some cold-iron knuckles to use.<br /><br />The rest of the group splits up to find information on the magical entity. Cross finds a cult who tells him a prophecy from Revelations (because they think he&#39;s speaking from god). They mention a figure like an antichrist who speaks for the devil, which Cross interprets as meaning that this entity might need a host or messenger.<br />Scene 5<br />Specter visits the underworld and speaks to an insane ghost girl about what happened. She killed herself after being possessed by the same entity. She says there is only One who is chosen that is the correct match. Specter then escapes the underworld after getting chewed out by his boss for being late for his pizza delivery job.<br /><br />Fiona is the last to do research. She finds several articles talking about missing and kidnapped children. She immediately thinks of Changeling because she&#39;s the type to do White Wolf LARPs. Fiona knows this is the work of a powerful faerie. Even the force in her head, a being of pure fear, is afraid of what is to come.<br />"

On the other, I want to leave a lot of blanks so that the character creation process can fill in the world with relevant NPCs that come with ties to the PCs, leaving the role of major villain to them to insert their Nemesis, spawned when they answer questions about their characters.

    "content": "I&#39;m looking for ideas on how to represent a character defined by their rejection of a villainous legacy or mentor... something like how Stephanie Brown became Spoiler as a heroic foil to her father, or Cassandra Cain&#39;s relationship with father David (I think Stephanie proposed a &quot;difficult parents club&quot; at some point).<br /><br />Both of these examples are un-powered individuals who could be played as a Beacon (indeed, Brown is listed as inspiration for that playbook), but the Beacon doesn&#39;t really focus on the right aspects of their stories. Whereas the Legacy and Protégé do focus on the relationship with an adult figure, but they&#39;re both the wrong kind of relationship... while not always working smoothly, both seem to expect a mostly-positive relationship rather than outright hostility.<br /><br />Thoughts? The character I&#39;m looking to model has powers, but they&#39;re relatively subtle... minor real magic masquerading as sleight of hand, that sort of thing. The Delinquent would be a pretty good match in terms of the moves, but likewise lacks the right focus and flavour..."

    "content": "I&#39;m on the Masks Discord, and I&#39;m currently running a game I&#39;m calling Fight for the Future. We&#39;ve done a session 0+1, and a session two. I&#39;ve asked certain members of the party to create &#39;Issues&#39; based off their character&#39;s PoV during the session. For the first session, here is the narrator&#39;s writeup of  &quot;Issue One.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;We open fifty years in the future. Halcyon City has become a haven for supervillainy in the world, and any hero that tries to stand up to the might of the once-revered members of the Dominion is destroyed. This is a bleak time, and the citizens of Halcyon live in fear. Metahumans are registered and regulated under the watch of the Reign, a constabulary established by the Dominion. Regular citizens have been turned into a workforce that serves the whims of the Dominion, and politicians have been utterly corrupted. Only the Dominion is law. <br /><br />There is an underground group of resistance fighters, named the Control, that seeks to displace the Dominion. There’s only one problem; they can’t do it in this time. <br /><br />The Control has selected one of their own, a young woman named Antiphon, to go back in time using a portal that one of their escaped metahumans created. Antiphon managed the jump back to the present day -- the Now -- and must find powerful young heroes of the past, and together they must prevent the future Antiphon knows.<br /><br />She was given a rota. Four powerful young heroes whose names still appeared in the rewritten history books. Alloy, a former underground gladiator, Aether, a being from outer space, Aria, an air-weaver who studied under the golem hero, Breakout, and Nightfall, whose family legacy stood as a paragon of hope in the old Halcyon city.  <br /><br />The heroes of the Now don’t know this yet. Right now, they’re getting pizza from a bowling alley, Sal’s Pins and Pies in the Commons neighborhood. It’s been a long day for these four heroes -- Captain Zeppelin and the High Flyers attacked the city -- they still have dust in their hair, but nothing says ‘kicking it’ like bowling and arcade games. <br /><br />They receive a mysterious message attached to the top of the pizza lid, and although suspicious, they decide to follow its instructions, and meet up with the author at an abandoned warehouse. There, they find Antiphon, who explains the terror of the Future, and enlists the four heroes to at least try to help save it. <br /><br />After some debate, the four heroes agree, and Antiphon gives them all small communicators which nestle into their hands, embedding Future technology into their palms. She asks that they meet her at the same place in two days. When they come back...Antiphon isn&#39;t there. <br /><br />They wait for her, and she finally crashes through the ceiling, yelling for the heroes to run. Aria and Nightfall bring the team together and as they prepare to fight, an all-encompassing darkness surrounds them all, resisting their attempts to break free. It doesn&#39;t take long, there is no fight, no battle, no struggle. This darkness drags them all in. The issue ends, and all of our heroes are floating in a dark, inky in-between, caught in a time-bending limbo.&quot;"

    "content": "I am running a game where players are attending the so-called Rook Academy (a bid by Rook to indoctrinate young supers), and created this move to create some more detail on their relationships with their peers and instructors (see below).<br /><br />Now my debate is this. In my next session, the heroes will face off with a villain whose technology is similar to that of Hardware, a Rook-allied adult hero. This is a fact they can exploit in the fiction to overcome the villain. I thought it would be cool if this comes to their attention via a flashback to one of their classes. I thought about adding this to the move as an option as a &quot;flashback&quot; hold type mechanic. But do I trust that someone at the table is going to make that roll and take the option, or do I just add that for free to force the issue?<br /><br /><b>The move</b><br /><br />At the Rook Academy, you are publicly trying to learn, but secretly keeping an eye on the practices of Rook Academy. How does this go? <br /><br />There are many instructors at Rook Academy, but a few stand out. <b>When attending class</b> at Rook Academy, choose one instructor that was particularly influential to you:<br /><b>Shadowblade</b> – A black man who appears to only have a black wardrobe, with the ability to conjure weapons out of shadow. Always very serious and dour. Sort of scary.<br /><b>Bastion</b> – He looks like a stereotypical eccentric science professor with pale skin and frizzy gray hair except for the chrome boxes protruding from his balding scalp. Has a genius level intellect and psychic powers.<br /><br />If you chose <b>Shadowblade</b>, roll + Superior.<br />If you chose <b>Bastion</b>, roll + Freak.<br /><br />On a 7-9 choose one. On a 10+, choose two:<br />- Gain insight or learn a secret about your instructor. They lose influence over you.<br />- You ingratiate yourself to your instructor. You gain influence over them.<br />- You and another Rook student (choose one or create a new one) form an accord to get by in the class; describe how. You gain influence over them. If you already have influence over them, instead describe how your experience affected you; shift the chosen label up and any other label down.<br /><br />On a miss, you cross your new instructor in a bad way; describe how. Mark a condition, and the GM will shift your labels.<br />"

Davey Prendergast, aka Fogchild, is a Janus of supernatural origins.  He can manifest ectoplasm in the form of tendrils (web generation) and use them for making basic objects, grapple ropes, weapons, and has been practicing with certain divining powers (supernatural senses).<br /><br />More to the character parts, I wanted to give the best effect of the Dangerous Web move--cribbing a phrase from JoJo by announcing how he saw his foe&#39;s move coming and planned accordingly.  (And like JoJo, it&#39;s mostly BS.)<br /><br />My question is whether Fogchild&#39;s Mask label would be better served by Freak or Superior.  Spooky effects with ghost fog lean one way, but the bravado and cunning lean another.<br /><br />(Also, I&#39;m thinking Ghostheart from the Deck of Villainy might want Davey dead more than most people...)"

Does the Grinning Man share the Suits&#39; goals?  Are they allies?  The possibilities make me giddy!",

    "content": "Alpine Academy, Session 3, Scene 1<br />So, I ran our third session of Masks the other night, and things went pretty well. Two of the characters were absent, but they were actually split from the party so we&#39;re just going to run their scene another time. For now, I&#39;ll explain that we started with Wispy. She&#39;s a pink haired hetrochromic girl who has connections to the Fae, she&#39;s basically a magical-hero in the vein of Doctor Strange, but her focus is mental magic. She uses telepathy and illusions and such. Last session she was hinting at the fact that she was being followed, so we started with that. She takes the bus home from the Hero school she attends (which pretends to be a regular private school and is mostly cloaked). When she arrives at the outskirts of the city, she notices strange noises coming from nearby. A group of goblins appear to be following her, magical creatures that only she can see. She detects them, but everyone else thinks she stares at air. She uses an illusion to give them the slip and moves around the back of her house. The goblins appear to be weakened  and slightly blinded by the sunlight, so they don&#39;t see her.<br /><br />When she finds her mom in the kitchen cooking, she tells her about the goblins out in the front doorway, which is hanging open. It was made known that Wispy&#39;s mother has red hair and her eyes are gold, whereas Wispy only has one golden eye. Wispy&#39;s mom plays along, knowing about her daughter&#39;s supernatural gifts, and pretends to scare away the goblins with her iron cooking pan. It actually works and they skitter away. Wispy goes to her room.<br />Scene 2<br />We see the anti-hero Dancing Shadow work out her stress from her previous battles in her own way. She shows off her &#39;costume&#39; for the first time. She wears a black ballerina leotard (no tutu) and an old halloween costume that makes her look like a hooded phantom. She returns to the scene of her previous battle with some villain henchmen at night. As a consequence of the battle, a building was destroyed and there is debris everywhere. Shadow uses her mental powers (which mostly influence fear and darkness, but she also has telekinesis) to scare some kids who are poking around the site. Her powers come out almost too potent, because she has little control over them. A tornado of dust and rocks soon forms around the children and all the nearby PCs come to see what is happening.<br /><br />Ninfu, (a modern alchemist/magical scientist) and Specter (an adrogenous ghost-mutant who works as a pizza boy) arrive on the scene. Wispy also teleports there, able to see the dust from her house.<br />Scene 3<br />Wispy reads Shadow&#39;s mind and determines that something is wrong with her. Her powers are controlled by some dark force within her mind, and the fae becomes determined to discover it. She pulls the nearby heroes into an astral space within Shadow&#39;s mind, much to the annoyance of Specter and even Shadow herself. Specter was in the middle of a job, and in his astral form he appears as a more feminine boy with different features in a sci-fi outfit. Ninfu glows with radiant light in the astral world. Wispy represents a more insectoid fae form, with curled legs and fairy wings.<br />Scene 4 <br />For the first time, the teen heroes have a leader outside of their normal teacher&#39;s aid in Wispy. She does her best to organize and unify the group, but Shadow refuses to help directly and warns them to leave. As they ignore her and enter the darkness, their fears come to life.<br /><br />Ninfu&#39;s power stems from the fact that she creates magical formula. One in particular involves using unicorn horn powder to preserve herself as a childish (loli) girl. She is extremely worried that if others found out about the formula they would hunt down unicorns to extinction. The fear manifests itself directly and the party is now in a forest illusion where poachers hunt unicorns in the backdrop. Arrows fly overhead.<br /><br />Specter attempts to catch the arrow, but finds that the illusions cause real pain. His transparent form begins leaking blood. Ninfu manifests a magical philosopher&#39;s stone within the mental space that allows her to focus her mental energy. She uses this mental energy to urge Specter to heal.<br />Scene 5<br />After the poachers fade away, Specter feels dejected because of the pain and stress and strangeness of the situation. His fear of being a burden and being mocked socially come into play. He sees illusions of his comrades mocking him (the PCs didn&#39;t really jump in to act things out, so i just described that he was being treated badly) and he is isolated by the darkness.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Wispy&#39;s fear (which is not directly shown) begins to swallow her up as well. Ninfu reacts quickly and shoves the magical stone into the cocoon of darkness. The shell is destroyed and the darkness is forced back. Everyone is shunted out of Shadow&#39;s mind.<br />Scene 6<br />Back in the real world, Specter and Shadow flee to return to their lives. They fall apart from the group and are unhappy with Wispy&#39;s choice to invade the astral space. Ninfu, by contrast, grows closer to Wispy due to the battle and decides to go home with her. We end on sort of a bookend, with Ninfu being introduced to Wispy&#39;s mother and sleeping over for the night. Wispy is happy she has somehow made a new (abnormal) friend."

    "content": "LOCKED LABELS AND MOVES REDUX<br /><br />In a separate thread, I asked a question about locked labels, and there was a lot of interesting talk.  However, on reflection it occurred to me that there can&#39;t be that many moves that specify a label, and therefore just itemizing them and saying what happens if the label is locked might actually be easier than coming up with some kind of consistent rule.  So, here they all are, with my take on what happens if the label is locked.  <br /><br />Bull - Punch everyone - if Danger is locked, nothing happens.<br /><br />Janus - 2nd Team Move - if either Mundane or the Mask label is locked, nothing shifts, but the Influence gain happens.<br /><br />Janus - the Mask - once either the Mundane or Mask Label are locked, affirming or denying your secret identity generates no effect.<br /><br />Legacy - 1st Team Move - if you tell someone they are not your equal, and Superior is locked, nothing happens.<br /><br />Legacy - I know what I am - if Savior is locked, then ignore the shift, you still add team to the pool the first time you defend a teammate.<br /><br />Nova - 1st Team Move - If they say yes and either Danger or Superior is locked, nothing happens.<br /><br />Outsider - Alien Ways - if Superior is locked, nothing happens.<br /><br />Transformed - 2nd Team Move - If they say gaining, and Mundane is locked, no shift happens but you still clear the condition.<br /><br />Reformed - What the hell, hero - on a miss, if Danger or Savior are locked the shift does not happen, but you still mark a condition of their choice.<br /><br />Reformed - Dark Past - if Danger is locked, no shift happens, but you still choose one from the list.<br /><br />Newborn - 2nd Team Move - if their response confuses/offends you and either Freak or Mundane is locked, nothing happens.<br /><br />Newborn - Thermodynamic Miracle - if they open up to you and either Freak or Mundane is locked, nothing happens.<br /><br />Innocent - What&#39;s this thing? - if you act the way they tell you and Mundane is locked, no shift happens but you still clear a condition.<br /><br />Martyr - if Savior is locked, nothing happens.<br /><br />Joined - Powers Activate! - if the assistants Superior or Mundane are locked, nothing happens to the assistant. The leader still unleashes their powers with combined Freak.  <br /><br />Brain - Mission Debrief - if Superior is locked, you no longer can mark potential by downplaying your role in the mission.<br /><br />Brain - Whenever you are confronted with your shame - if Superior or Danger are locked, you must mark a condition.<br /><br />Soldier - I can do this all day - if Savior is locked, you cannot stop yourself from leaving the fight. <br /><br />Soldier - Mission First - if Savior is locked, no shift happens, but if you avoided causing collateral damage you still clear a condition.<br /><br />Two comments - <br /><br />1) The only move that seems to me to simply be broken by locking the label is the Soldier&#39;s I can do this all day.  By broken I mean the move just makes no sense anymore, by locking Savior I can&#39;t do it all day anymore?  That just seems weird.  Its the only one where I think considering a change in wording after the player locks Savior is worth talking about.<br /><br />2) I disagreed with <span class=\"proflinkWrapper\"><span class=\"proflinkPrefix\">+</span><a class=\"proflink\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/104242213536336786514\" oid=\"104242213536336786514\">Brendan Conway</a></span> on the Brain&#39;s Mission Debrief.

If you accept what they say, the GM adjusts your Labels accordingly; if you want to keep your Labels as they are, you must reject their Influence.&quot;<br /><br />Reading this, it seems clear the GM adjusts the labels EVEN IF the situation is a PC to PC interaction.  Yet that is not the way we have played it; between PC&#39;s we have had the Influencing PC say what is shifted.  Is there a rule I am missing?  Did I just get confused by the rule on page 77 which definitely says if you GAIN influence over a PC you already have influence over you (the player, not GM) decide which labels shift?  How do you play this between PCs?"

    "content": "<a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/YLlHnuK\" class=\"ot-anchor\">https://imgur.com/a/YLlHnuK</a><br /><br />My second homebrew playbook, the Regressed. This playbook represents a teenage superhero who used to be an adult, but was somehow de-agified back into a youthful body and mind. Now, stuck as a kid with all of their adult responsibilities looming on one side, and the respect and stability that comes with it, and the fear, insecurity, freedom, and comfort of childhood on the other, they must come to terms with their own feelings regarding themselves, their past, the future, who they could be, and how their first go-around of life turned out.<br /><br />Mechanically, the Regressed is not pulled toward any one Label. None of their moves involve rolling a particular Label, substituting one Label for another, or shifting a specific Label up or down. But they do have several ways to quickly shift their Labels around to explore themselves and become new things from session to session. Their Extra, Caught In Between, pulls them between sharp outbursts of either radical reinvention or authority and competence.<br /><br />As with the Host, I do have some ongoing Masks games, and would like to eventually use this for actual play! So any critique or suggestions on how to improve are welcome. (The art for the Regressed isn&#39;t done yet, so please excuse the blank space on page 1.)<br />",

    "content": "Another idea to float past the fellows.  Out of the listed abilities for the Nova, I&#39;m surprised that one of those isn&#39;t weather control.  A power that, the more I think about it, is made for the concept.<br /><br />Like the Nova abilities, weather powers are incredibly open ended and limited only by imagination.  Jojo&#39;s Stone Ocean arc features a character that makes other weather masters seem like amateurs, even if some uses stretch it a bit.<br /><br />Furthermore, and more importantly, weather powers are the stuff of horror stories for uncontrollable mayhem.  There are so many variables in play to make weather function that creating desired effects is downright miraculous.<br /><br />Probably just out of room on the playbook, but yeah.  Nova controlling weather seems like a great basis for a character."

Would the completely different form make others not even consider a secret identity?  Does the Moment of Truth belie a literal unmasking or just an outing of the person behind the mask?<br /><br />Or am I just thinking too hard about this exercise in creating a hybrid between Diego Brando and Old Lace from the Runaways?",

    "content": "It&#39;s looking like a player in my campaign (the Beacon) will have to miss three sessions in a row. We are all a bit bummed about it. I&#39;m thinking over how to handle this so that positive things come out of it for his character and for the story. I&#39;m open to advice!<br /><br />My basic idea is to chat with my player about what he&#39;d like his character to do, in general terms, during the sessions he&#39;ll miss. I may suggest playing to some of his current Beacon drives: Take down a threat all on his own, and Travel to an incredible place or time.<br /><br />Then I&#39;ll craft love letters based on that, probably one for each missed session. I&#39;ll also allow/encourage the players to play a couple out-of-session roleplaying scenes (in a Google doc or something like that) for times the Beacon is able and willing to communicate with the team.<br /><br />How have your playgroups handled things like this? Or how would you advise me to proceed here? Any tips are welcome!"

Wanting to participate in humanity’s destruction without being human herself, The Resurrector uploaded her mind into a set of three helmets, each of which controls an animal. The helmets can be finicky and mentally disorienting, though, so she takes turns focusing on controlling the actions of one animal and amplifying her voice through that one helmet at a time. The animals, when not under her direct control, are easily distracted, and charge at anything that taunts them. The shark has water tanks for its gills and two nimble robotic arm/legs.<br /><br />Moves:<br />-Frighten and endanger innocents with the mindless rage of a hungry beast<br />-Coordinate a surprise attack by using one animal as a loud distraction<br />-Send the woolly mammoth on an unrelenting rampage through the streets<br />-Use the T-Rex’s jaws to send large and important things flying<br />-Show surprising and dangerous agility as the robotic shark<br /><br />Conditions:<br />Angry<br />Guilty<br />Hopeless<br />Insecure<br />",

With as many schools as you&#39;ve attended, it&#39;s crazy that a new one would put you on edge.<br /><br />And yet...<br /><br />How&#39;ve things been going?<br /><br />Roll +Danger. On a 10+, pick 2. On a 7-9, pick 1.<br /><br />* Gardner crawls with supers and the so-called elite, and with you as one of the faces of the Menagerie and recently dropping your Mask on YouTube, you&#39;re an easy target for every wannabe with an opinion. But you rise above it - you know who you are, you know whose opinions you care about. Tell us about someone trying to make an example of you, and how you shut them down.<br />* [Only on a 10+, and only when paired with option one: Also take influence over that person.]<br />* The rumor mill has been churning non-stop about, of all people, Summer and Aria. You caught a whiff of it, and it smelled rotten, but you&#39;re not going White-Knight them - tell us about the opportunity you managed to subtly give the girls to address things on their own. (And did they do so, or didn&#39;t bother?)<br />* GYRO, the science instructor, has been notoriously unpredictable when it comes to metahuman students with a knack for Science. <i>&quot;Sometimes she loves you, sometimes... it&#39;s the other thing.&quot;</i> Did you impress her, surprise her, or frighten her? What happened?<br /><br />On a miss, pick 1, but with everything <i>else</i> going on, and Vector&#39;s revelations about the future, school has been seriously stressing you out - you snapped at Trace during practice, loud and hard, he left before you could figure out how to pull things back, and now half the team is gunning for you to take his place as team captain. (Wtf?!?)<br /><br />Hugs and kisses,<br />Editorial<br /><br />----<br /><br />Dear Harry, [the Legacy]<br /><br />It’s been the longest week at Gardner you have ever. experienced.

You break through on the whole speed-reading trick, and use the recovered homework time to coordinate a team visit to the hospital. Name someone critical to your plan for helping Dad: they get a +1 on a roll toward that end, based on &quot;the plan,&quot; OR you get a +1 to Provoke your mom into allowing their help (which also has to happen).<br />* So you&#39;ve tangled with your first real speedster. Wow. You&#39;ve been doing a lot of research on both what Vector was able to do with his powers, and what Leo has told you about the speedster&#39;s background. (Or is that foreground? Time travel is confusing.) Take +1 forward on a Vector-related roll.<br />* Uncle Chase taught you his &quot;super-charge&quot; trick, and it. is. awesome. Take +1 on your next Directly Engage or Unleash roll that uses his trick.<br /><br />On a miss, pick 1, but Andi&#39;s seriously starting to wonder how a speedster can be so slow to take a hint. Lose influence with Andi and take Guilty. Time to make with the apologies...<br /><br />High speed high-fives,<br />Editorial<br /><br />----<br /><br />Dear Concord, [the Nova]<br /><br />New schools are hard. New schools when you&#39;re trying to balance the power of the Concordance and a Keynome inside your chest (sort of? somewhere? it&#39;s Weird...) is REALLY hard.<br /><br />Roll +Freak.

You get a vision of your (well, Sol&#39;s) replacement. Tell us what you see and take +1 forward when you face them.<br />* You&#39;ve figured out (with help) what you need to do to help out Harry&#39;s dad. Store 2 Burn that can be used only on affecting Silver Streak&#39;s condition.<br /><br />On a miss, pick as though you rolled a 7-9, and your powers have attracted attention at the worst possible time, hopelessly complicating what was already a rotten week. Tell us if this at School, Home, or In the Public Eye, and get ready to Take a Powerful Blow.<br /><br />Hugs,<br />Editorial<br /><br />----<br /><br />Dear Charlotte, [the Outsider]<br /><br />The boys (and girls?) are all back at school, and all the ghosts in the cemetery are calling you &quot;General&quot; and seem to know what happened in the Sepiaverse. Oh, and they&#39;re waiting (or dreading) to find out what you want them to do.<br /><br />Roll +Savior. On a 10+, pick 1. On a 7-9, pick 1, and you attract some dangerous attention.<br /><br />* You&#39;ve got a solid theory on how to heal the World Wounds, and just need [teammate or NPC&#39;s] help with implementation/testing.<br />* You&#39;ve got a solid theory on how to find all the World Wounds, and just need [teammate or NPC&#39;s] help with testing the theory.<br /><br />On a miss, pick 1 as a 7-9, and the spirit world is completely behind you, but the ghosts seem to be... reflecting your fierce desire to protect them and the world a little <i>too</i> vehemently. Poltergeist-like hauntings are up over three hundred percent, the effected area is large, it&#39;s all centered on your cemetery and that high-rise Rook is so interested in, and someone has leaked to the press that&#39;s it&#39;s obviously because of you.<br /><br />TTFN,<br />Editorial<br /><br /><br />----<br /><br />Dear Alycia, [the Reformed]<br /><br />School is torture. Not literally, of course, but... okay, maybe literally.<br /><br />Still, you&#39;re doing your best. You think.<br /><br />Roll +Mundane. On a 10+, pick 2. On a 7-9, pick 1.<br /><br />* You bonded with a team mate over something, very likely at school. Tell us what happened, and with whom. Add +1 team to the pool and ask the team mate if you get Influence (and why or why not).<br />* Special Agent Parker has been marginally more open to your comings and goings. You get two hours &quot;unsupervised&quot; time after school before the AEGIS van shows up to cart you back to the facility. How have you been spending it?<br />* Almost (or entirely) by accident, you&#39;ve made a friend/admirer/worshiper out of someone at Gardner. Who is it, and... what the heck happened?<br /><br />On a miss, pick 1, but an &quot;old friend&quot; comes crashing into your new life with a crisis and a favor to call in.<br /><br />Hugs and kisses,<br />Editorial"

    "content": "Universe-wide Crossover Events are a thing that happens in comic books.  The modern format seems to be a main limited series with all the big actions scenes and major plot points, a few more limited series that focus on an integral-to-the-event character or team, and then tie-ins in all the ongoing books.  Some books end and others begin.<br /><br />In actual practice, it&#39;s often terrible, because the centerpiece is an eight issue hero-vs-hero slugfest, and those are usually the least entertaining sorts of superhero comics.  But if played as a genre trope, you can get some wonderful results.  There was the great episode of Justice League Unlimited that followed Booster Gold as every superhero except him was battling a cosmic evil.<br /><br />Is this a trope you&#39;ve integrated into your games?  My own answers in the comments."

Like if it’s the first thing in the scene and someone is falling out of the sky can I go to roll burn and FOLLOW UP with an actual action or no? Like it makes no sense for me to be able to roll burn and but not be able to actually do a thing immediately after that to spend that burn until my next turn..<br />Can someone help me with what the official ruling is on this?"

    "content": "Since someone in the group asked for more examples of Love Letters, here are two that I sent to my players to resolve dangling plot threads between sessions.<br /><br />Torque is an Outsider who ended the last session by chasing a fleeing villain in his kirby-kraft (the Lever). Sonia is a Bull who ended last session accompanying a young girl (Aislin), someone changed by the same folks who changed Sonia, as the city&#39;s premier science hero tries to remove Aislin&#39;s hi-tech bracelet that those people have used to knock her out or forcibly teleport her.<br /><i>_______________________________________</i><br /><br />Dear Torque,<br /><br />So, you want to capture Quartermaster? Well, sport, you’ve taken the first step: flying the Lever out the window of Crimebusters Visitor Center. But now you’ve got to pick up Quartermaster’s trail and overtake him, and then overcome the hardened criminal.<br /><br />Since you’re relying on the Lever, you’ll roll +Superior, that is +1. On a hit, you overtake Quartermaster (and therefore clear Guilty). On a 10+ choose one complication from the list below. On a 7-9, choose two complications.<br /><br />\t• F.A.T.E. hails you again, demanding you ground your craft and explain your reckless flying to F.A.T.E. air traffic control. You ignore them in order to stay on Quartermaster’s trail, and F.A.T.E. opens fire with anti-aircraft weapons on the Lever, essentially trying to taze your ship. The Lever takes some damage, and you know that this could cause problems later if you don’t take some time to see about repairing it.<br /><br />\t• You catch up to Quartermaster and get in a couple hits, but he tosses down a sound bomb and gets away. However, one weapon you used tagged him with an exotic “scent,” so the Lever could home in on his location if he’s ever close enough to you again.<br /><br />\t• Penny Dreadnought also catches up to Quartermaster. He pulls up on his motorized Penny Farthing and launches himself off to grapple with the villain. “Get back, Spaceman!’ Penny Dreadnought yells at you. “This is a time for fighting man-to-man, not fancy flying!” His words shift your Danger down and your Freak up.<br /><br />On a miss, you are unable to catch up to Quartermaster before he goes to ground. Darn that stealthy mercenary! You don’t clear Guilty, and you mark an additional condition of your choice, whatever makes most sense to you based on the scenario.<br /><br />XXOO,<br />Your Gamemaster<br /><br /><i>_____________________</i><br /><br /><br />Dear Sonia,<br /><br />Last we saw, you were accompanying Aislin to Doc Quantum’s lab, where she and her aides investigated whether they could remove Aislin’s Forge bracelet. Based on your requests, it seems you would like to have Doc Quantum release Aislin into your custody AND to receive the casing of a Forge bracelet—just the metal shell with the electronic guts scooped out.<br /><br />Let’s see how you do at this. This challenge will revolve around people skills. So roll +Mundane—that is, -1.<br /><br />On a 10+, you get your wish. Aislin has clearly bonded with you and asks to go with you. Doc Quantum initially hesitates to release her into your custody, but you let her know you’re going to rely on your nun friend for help. Doc Quantum is able to take apart the extra bracelet and, at your request, gives you the casing. She holds onto the electronics inside for further study.<br /><br />On a 7-9, choose one of the following modifications to this outcome:<br /><br />\t• Aislin, as she recovers consciousness, becomes confused and uncommunicative—perhaps the trauma of what she’s undergone is coming crashing down on her. She doesn’t respond positively to you or anyone else around—which means by default she remains with Doc Quantum as Doc Quantum tries to figure out what should be done with her.<br /><br />\t• Doc Quantum and her assistants can’t find a safe way to remove Aislin’s bracelet. The best they can do is clamp a larger bracelet-shaped device around it that should make it impossible for Aislin’s to receive any outside signals.<br /><br />\t• Doc Quantum wants to hang onto all the pieces of the Forge bracelet to study it. When you ask for the shell of one, she inquires why you would need that and is unconvinced by your explanation. You leave without a Forge bracelet casing.<br /><br />On a miss, all three of the above are true. Aislin clams up. She remains in Doc Quantum’s custody for the time being as Doc Quantum works on removing the bracelet, which has proven an extremely tough nut to crack. You’ll have to visit again (perhaps with a certain comfort object?) and take another shot. Mark Angry, as you seethe about how this went down.<br /><br />XXOO,<br />Your Gamemaster"

    "content": "I&#39;m thinking more and more of moves as rulings, and feeling more freedom to write custom moves as the situation demands - usually to satisfy one of the game&#39;s principles, when an existing move feels inadequate. This includes coming up with moves as a <i>player</i>, and suggesting them to the GM.<br /><br />For example, my PC has technology that can &quot;remix&quot; existing human memories, and this is how he produced his AI friends. It&#39;s not a general-purpose memory editor, it only facilitates the creation or repair of living minds on their own terms. Another PC, and his NPC love interest, both shared plenty of experiences, but had also lost memories or emotional contexts. So we put this tech to use fixing that. Rather than <b>Unleash Your Powers</b>, I wanted a move that put control over those characters&#39; fates in their hands, and gave them as much authority as they could. The resulting suggestion to the GM (and adopted as written, and used successfully) was this:<br /><br /><b>When your memories are remixed with someone else&#39;s via Newman neurotech</b>, roll +Conditions. On a hit, the resulting connectome (a map of how a brain is wired) is stable, and the merge goes forward. On 10+, pick three side effects. On 7-9, pick one.<br /><br />1. An important existing memory takes on a new form, or you get a new perspective on it<br />2. You get memories the other person would prefer you don&#39;t get<br />3. You gain one of their goals or plans; if it&#39;s something you wouldn&#39;t have done before, mark potential if you do it<br />4. Your ego is in flux; the GM shifts your labels<br />5. Their relationships bleed into yours; give Influence to the other person, or to someone they give Influence to<br /><br />On a miss, choose one: the connectome isn&#39;t viable and the merge can&#39;t take place and you must try again after time passes, <b>or</b> the merge succeeds but your ego is wildly in flux - the GM will rearrange your labels as they see fit and you take a powerful blow.<br />"

I&#39;ve been using &quot;this young NPC takes Influence over you&quot; as a hard move when players fail rolls like Assess or Comfort/Support outside of battle. I&#39;ve also prompted my players to say whether a young NPC has Influence over them when the story suggests that NPC does. <br /><br />How does this sound to other GMs in the group? And how have you approached young NPCs taking Influence over player characters?<br /><br />Here is the art:<br />Sonia (The Bull)<br />Captain Bowmaster (The Beacon)<br />Torque (The Outsider)<br />Panic (The Delinquent)<br />and<br />Halfpenny (The Protégé), a guest star who may be joining the campaign and the team.<br />",

At the same time I love the characters and world they have developed, and enjoy all the material produced that is incidental to the game itself. With that in mind, I have been tossing around the idea of a Masks game inspired by Overwatch. <br /><br />I&#39;m not sure if it makes sense to set such a game in the pre-existing world, with the players as a kind of rising New Overwatch, or if it would be more enjoyable to establish some general understandings based on the game (notably that there was some kind of worldwide crisis to pull a group of heroes together and a scandal that blew them apart) and do some world designing with players. <br /><br />I am inclined towards the second one, which almost has a solar-punk apocalypse world feel, but I also think the first one might have some appeal to new players of Masks. Any ideas or opinions?"

    "content": "What are the limits of the &quot;take something from them&quot; option in Directly Engage a Threat?<br /><br />When my players use the Directly Engage move, on a hit, they have a habit of coming up with stuff like &quot;I want to take something from them. Can I take their vitality? What about their sight? Can I take their secrets? Or their will to fight? Or their powers?&quot;<br /><br />I&#39;ve been nixing anything that would end the fight before the villain&#39;s conditions are all checked, but I&#39;m not sure how far to let them stretch the definition of that option. (At least one player has vitality draining powers and psychic abilities, so some of these requests are somewhat reasonable.)<br /><br />So clearly, &quot;I want to take their sight&quot; is actually &quot;temporarily blind them&quot; which is basically &quot;create an opportunity&quot;, or maybe &quot;impress, surprise, or frighten&quot;.<br /><br />Is &quot;take information/take a secret&quot; a reasonable use of the option?<br /><br />If they try something like, &quot;take their self confidence&quot;, could I let them pick which of the villain&#39;s condition get&#39;s marked? (Insecure, in that case).<br /><br />What if the villain doesn&#39;t have anything worth taking (and i can&#39;t invent something off the top of my head)? Do I just say &quot;there&#39;s nothing here to take, choose another option).<br /><br />(I love my players, I love how creative they are, and that&#39;s why they drive me crazy. :) )"

    "content": "I have a Doomed in one of my games that asked to have time pass differently in her Sanctuary as one of the downsides. The location is a pocket dimension dream world where she can retreat, so time passes as it does when you dream, sometimes very little time passing, sometimes a great deal more. I decided to make a custom move to figure it out as I love when moves create that little bit of chaos during play that requires me to &quot;take a powerful blow&quot; as GM to figure out how to weave it all together.<br /><br />Here is the current rough draft:<br /><br />Time Elapse<br /><br />When you spend time in Changeling&#39;s Sanctuary, she will roll+Current Doom Track, on a miss no time has passed at all, you arrive where you were in the same moment that you left. On a 7-9, it has been 2d6xCurrent Doom Track minutes since you entered. On a 10+, it has been 2d6xCurrent Doom Track hours since you entered.<br /><br />I decided to have it replicate the Take a Powerful Blow move so it is inverted (high roll = worse outcome) with the current doom track determining what to add to the roll. I wasn&#39;t comfortable assigning arbitrary values to the amount of time that passed though, so I went with random rolls for the time, probably rolled by the person affected, whereas the roll to see where you fall in the time elapse is always rolled by Changeling. As written the smallest amount of elapsed time, if time has elapsed, is 2 minutes, the greatest possible amount of time elapsed is 2 days(!!!).<br />The themes that have come up in the game thus far (just played the first full play session yesterday) have fallen along the lines of ancestry/lineage, the way the public interacts/reacts to young heroes, especially when they screw up in very public ways, and time manipulation (via an artifact that has formed the basis of the first arc thus far).<br /><br />What do folks think? Can anyone think of any improvements?<br /><br />Also, I love this game. Seriously. So freaking fun!"

I took a vote from my players and let them all request a couple of popular characters to put in the game, with tweaks, so that they fit in the setting - which is how Stevie Ramsey, our current iteration of Venom, got there! (And yes, they lost their arm in an accident but use the symbiote to grow it back when they&#39;re suited up.) <br /><br />Then we have my two OCs, Synapse and Magma!<br /><br /> Synapse (Marcus Samson) is a veteran hero, a telekinetic super with some very mild telepathic powers - at most he can read &#39;true&#39; emotions. Which helps a lot in his civilian job - being a therapist. He works mostly with people under 30 and specializes in grief counseling and certain personality disorders. (And he has a therapy cat named Ham, who has a backstory all her own, hah!)<br /><br />Magma (Ethan Morey) is Synapse&#39;s partner in hero work and at their job. He&#39;s a pyrokinetic similar to Johnny Storm, except his whole body isn&#39;t normally consumed by fire when he&#39;s working. He&#39;s not very creative, and his costume reflects that. Off the hero clock, Ethan is Marcus&#39; secretary and assistant. <br /><br />Ethan and Marcus are an active part of the PCs&#39; lives as of right now, since we&#39;re still in &#39;building the context/story&#39; mode. Marcus is part of the New Hero Initiative, a team of veteran heroes who help gather resources for newbies. And Stevie will be having their own part in the heroes&#39; story in a few sessions. :P  <br /><br />These are all really sketchy and messy because I have commissions to work on and can&#39;t spend a lot of time working on personal art.

It was apparent to all the veterans here that it didn&#39;t gel, but I do still have ideas regarding the characters.<br /><br />Firstly, Thug Boy--a younger version--would make for an interesting take on the Reformed. Not quite an ex-villain, but a former anti-super terrorist now connected to the team by a relationship. The existence of the Hatchlings from the HCHC seems like a great basis for a normal person with superhuman weapons and tactics. My primary question is who would make for good contacts.<br /><br />Thoughts?"

    "content": "So I&#39;m running my first campaign of Masks and it&#39;s going pretty well. The first arc the team will be dealing with (BTW Spoilers if you are a member of the Losers Club) concerns itself with a substance called Mutagen being sold around the city. Mutagen is dangerous but can give people superpowers under the right circumstances.<br /><br />One particular strand of this arc will involve an NPC trying to sell our Beacon some Mutagen to give them real powers. This is the first draft of the custom move for what happens when a PC uses Mutagen. Just wanted to get people&#39;s opinions on it, and see if any more experienced GMs can give advice.<br /><br />&quot;When you Ingest Mutagen. If you are the Nova, your powers overwhelm the Mutagen and nothing happens, mark a condition. Otherwise…<br />Roll +Mundane.<br />On a 10+ choose 2<br />On a 7-9 choose 3<br />-\tYou get new powers. Select 1 power from a playbook not currently in use. Add it to your list of powers.<br />-\tYou are horribly disfigured. Swap your Mundane label with your Freak. Take the move “Be the monster” from the Transformed playbook.<br />-\tYou are overwhelmed by the Mutagen. Mark all conditions and become unconscious.<br />-\tYou become doomed. Take Doom from the Doomed playbook. You do not get Doomsigns. Once your Doom Track is full, your doom arrives.<br />On a miss, the Mutagen doesn’t take hold. How frustrating! Mark a condition.&quot;<br /><br />I&#39;m making them roll Mundane for the check because it&#39;s more dramatic for a character who is perceived to be normal to suddenly get a power boost, Rather than a freaky character to become more freaky. The intention is that if this move ever comes up it is a character changing moment.<br /><br />I included the thing about the Nova because the Nova in our group is already basically God, they don&#39;t really need more powers.<br /><br />I&#39;m unsure about the doomed option. Partially because we have a doomed in the group and I don&#39;t want to rob them of their unique thing, and partially because it&#39;s kind of a &quot;rocks fall you die&quot; option. If anyone can think of a better option please let me know.<br /><br />So yeah, that&#39;s it, let me know what you think. :)"

    "content": "Black Panther Thoughts on Shuri and STEAM:<br /><br />Rather than the face of STEM, I think Shuri is if anything the face of STEAM. I think most people know that this stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math, though they may be less familiar with rationales for what the arts provide to that construction.<br /><br />There is an unfortunate assumption that it either serves only to make STEM ideas palatable to non-scientifically inclined people or that STEM has the power to make artistic ideas a reality. What the Arts actually do is incorporate a human element. If you are considering user-centered design, whether from the aesthetic, cultural, or experiential angle, then you are required to envision and react to those potential users using knowledge that exists solidly in the artistic realm.<br /><br />You can see Shuri’s appreciation for the arts in how she dresses and carries herself, and in her general practice of looking forward while still maintaining a cultural connection to Wakanda. Her designs are functional and elegant, and clearly reference designs, patterns, and uses that have emerged over the centuries in the isolated Afro-utopia that is Wakanda. You can also see this design philosophy in the nation’s buildings, styles of dress, rituals, and more or less every other aspect of life.<br /><br />The various disciplines in STEAM can’t really be isolated in these constructions, so seamlessly are they integrated together. This is something of the whole point of STEAM for me, that concepts coexist to the point of complete synthesis. Essentially, STEAM ceases to exist because it is integral to thought.<br /><br />This also points out part of the problem with using either STEM or STEAM within this context, which is that they are essentially Western divisions and unifications of thought. The terms (in my head canon) would be meaningless to a Wakandan, because they do not impose those separations in the same manner. Certainly, they would understand technology as an area of specialty, but to pull it apart from their history, philosophy, and people? Never."

Do the playbook Moves still work? Would another playbook fit the concept better?<br /><br />This is what my brain does to me when I wake up. :-)"

    "content": "Just wanted to share some of my homebrew moves for my PBP campaign I am on running on the Sufficient Velocity forums, Night City Heights (It takes place in a Gotham Analogue to Halcyon Cities Metropolis), any feedback would be accepted, I haven&#39;t gotten around to the first combat phase yet, so they are untested. This is my first campaign running a Masks RPG, and I&#39;m really liking the system so far!<br /><br />=STAND STRONG WHILE DRAMATICALLY UNDER FIRE=<br />You’re taking hits! Evasive maneuvers! I will occasionally call on you to act under fire whenever your current action is taking place when you under extreme duress-like a powerful blow, but much less likely to down you. Also a lot more common-even enemies that can&#39;t hurt you normally, can get lucky if there is enough of them.<br /><br />When you are acting under fire, roll + conditions marked, – your Danger label. On a 10+, choose one.<br /><br />• you immediately take a powerful blow!<br />• two options from the 7-9<br /><br />On a 7-9, choose one.<br /><br />• you disadvantage your teammates somehow in your panic to avoid injury, perhaps inadvertently-choose a teammate, they gain -1 to their next roll.<br />• you take the hits, but keep going: Take -3 to your next roll.<br />• you bear the pain: mark a condition.<br /><br />On a miss, you duck and weave perfectly. Mark potential as normal, and say how you avoided being injured.<br /><br />((Essentially I wanted a less deadly version of &#39;Take a powerful blow&#39;-for when a Hero is more actively avoiding things that can hurt or hinder them, than taking a hit on the chin-like trying to move under a hail of machine gun fire. Honestly, I wasn&#39;t sure as a newbie GM how to make sure my Beacon player got value from his move &#39;Suck it Domitian&#39; without being pounded into a crater every encounter, so I essentially added the effect in the description as an actual move.))<br /><br />=POWERING UP=<br />Sometime including a lot of yelling, floating rocks, and a generous amount of screen time-a character powering up is gathering all their strength for a heroic effort, either through gathering energy or sheer willpower. They are vulnerable during this time however.<br /><br />When you are powering up, roll +Freak. On a hit…<br /><br />• Your next turns roll for directly engaging will always score an extra success, even if you miss-add this onto any successes you get normally. You are far less likely to sustain damage while trading blows if you are powered up and they are not, though common sense does apply. Collateral damage and unintended effects will be much more dramatic.<br /><br />• For the next turn only you can choose to use the Adult move ‘wield your powers’. If you already have this move, add an extra success onto the result of your roll.<br /><br />On a miss, your efforts backfire and you end up worse than before. Indicate in specific detail how many square miles of Night City you have just destroyed.<br /><br />You only power up once a phase, and afterwards, you may be unable to power up until some time has passed or you recharge yourself somehow.<br /><br />((Since I run things in distinct turn phases, I added this. I like the flavor of a distinct risk+reward move that can go very good...or very bad. ))<br /><br /><br />=THE FUTURE IS WORTH THE FIGHT=<br />In a display of super-heroic leadership, you inspire your allies, intimidate your opponents, give solid commands, or otherwise attempt to guide your team to victory with an impassioned speech.<br /><br />When you use this move, roll + Savior. On a hit…<br /><br />• For that turn, all your allies can choose to use your Savior label to roll for any move in place of whatever they would normally roll. They temporarily ignore all penalties from their conditions.<br /><br />• On this turn and the next one, you decide on your teams big plan and the goal you wish to achieve-any team spent from the pool for team moves is automatically refunded if the overall action you plan for your team is a success.<br /><br />• All allies and yourself can choose to clear a single condition.<br /><br />• For this turn you can take an extra action-you can only choose to use the Adult move ‘Stand up for Something’. If you already have this move, add an extra success onto the result of your roll.<br /><br />You only get one big speech per phase, and may have to wait some time before you gain the courage to try something like again. Not limited to the leader of the group, but only one sort of this action can take place during a phase. Who wants the spotlight?<br /><br />On a miss, you suffer no other penalty, except looking a little foolish-but maybe your words will still strike hard, despite you not putting it the best way.<br /><br /><br />((The same as the last, I wanted something extra for Savior-it also gives my players incentives for big Heroic speeches!))<br /><br />Does anyone else use homebrew moves in their campaigns?"

In Teen Titans, for instance, the young heroes were given their own city to protect, but the setting being Halcyon city doesn&#39;t really seem to allow for that. "

    "content": "<b>Training Session Moves</b><br /><br />Our Legacy is trying to convince his uncle (adult hero &quot;Comet&quot;) to let a fellow group of young heroes (whom his uncle mentors) get out and do some proper caping.<br /><br />Comet agreed... provided the PC&#39;s team meets up with Comet&#39;s team for some training, to both prove to Comet his team is ready... and that the PC&#39;s team isn&#39;t just some lucky fluke.<br /><br />For this, I worked up some custom moves depending on how the individual players approach the scenarios presented by Comet and HCPD Sgt. Amari, plus some moves for when the teams work together.<br /><br />These moves don&#39;t have any context regarding what the scenario actually will be - for that, I built a basic list of possible scenarios I&#39;ll be cribbing from to provide color (assuming we don&#39;t come up with something better in game).<br /><br />In case anyone might make use of them, here are the moves in question and, below that, the list of possible training scenarios.<br /><br />-------<br /><br />When you <b>*play along with Comet&#39;s training scenario*</b>, roll +Superior. On a 10+, you nail it, and Comet acknowledges your readiness; either take Influence over him, remove his Influence over you, or (if neither of those apply) mark Potential. On a 7-9, you succeed, but can&#39;t help but see both Comet&#39;s point with the exercise, and where you could have done better; Comet shifts your labels accordingly. On a miss, Comet&#39;s debrief is <i>rough</i>; mark a Condition, and Comet shifts your labels and gains Influence over you if he did not already have it (if he did already have it, mark a second condition). <br /><br />(Note: label shifting by Comet may inflict an additional Condition.)<br /><br />----<br /><br />When you <b>*go off the script with Comet&#39;s training scenario*</b>, roll +Danger. On a 10+, you succeed at the scenario, at least technically, and - let&#39;s be honest - feel pretty smug about it. Shift your labels, and remove Comet&#39;s influence over you. On a 7-9, you accomplished the primary goal, at the cost of some secondary objective blah blah blah you weren&#39;t really listening (be cool and everyone will think it doesn&#39;t bother you). Mark a condition, OR pick a teammate you (accidentally?) left hanging so you could get the &#39;W&#39; - lose influence over them (or, if you don&#39;t have influence over them, give them a Condition, the GM suggests Angry).<br /><br />On a miss, your gamble does not pay off AT. All. You badly and blatantly overstep some of the guidelines. Comet&#39;s dressing down is harsh, and painfully insightful; Take a Powerful Blow and choose one teammate you left hanging when you made your move; have them shift your labels.<br /><br />(Note: label shifting may inflict an additional Condition.)<br /><br />----<br /><br />When you <b>*play along with Sgt. Amari&#39;s training scenario*</b>, roll +Mundane. On a 10+, you nail it, and Nasir sees you as a hero, even without the powers; either take Influence over him, remove his Influence over you, or (if neither of those apply) mark Potential. On a 7-9, you succeed, but it&#39;s an eye-opening experience, you really need to be ready for anything; Amari shifts your labels during his debrief. On a miss, Nasir&#39;s debrief leaves you questioning how much of your hero status lies with your powers, not you. Take Insecure, and Nasir shifts your labels.

    "content": "Hey guys! Just wanted to share a few things that I borrowed from other systems that helped me run my games smoothly. So I don&#39;t have a lot of experience in both playing and running Masks. The first time I ran it, it went horribly because I didn&#39;t understand the system properly and combat was really confusing (I&#39;m so used to initiative order, gah!). The second time though, I had more time to prepare and drew experience from running different games about kids/teenagers like Tales from the Loop (Tftl) and Bubblegumshoe. So what started initially as a Masks one-shot has now become a campaign because everyone had a lot of fun and my players seem pretty emotionally invested! As a GM, it&#39;s a dream come true :D<br /><br />I didn&#39;t prep much beyond the first few scenes, hoping the players would pave the path for me instead and I would pepper said path with problems and obstacles for them to overcome. And what really helped was structuring the session the way I would with a Tales from the Loop game (which I had more experience with).<br /><br />For those who don&#39;t know, in TfTl, you have two types of scenes:<br />1. Mundane/slice of life scenes - Kids interact with their families, do stuff at school, clear conditions by spending time with their anchors (a trusted adult that comforts them), do 80&#39;s kids stuff<br />2. Mystery scenes - Kids go on adventures, discover clues, solve problems, etc<br /><br />You also have the Game Flow:<br />1. Introduce the Kids<br />2. Introduce the Mystery<br />3. Solving the Mystery<br />4. The Showdown<br />5. Aftermath <br />6. Change<br /><br />So for a Masks game, I did something similar but switched Mystery scenes with Superhero Life scenes and have them going on missions, interacting with Supers from the United Metahuman Agency (a fictional superhero organization we made up in Halcyon City), and combat. This structure worked wonderfully because we had a Janus who needed those mundane scenes to show her juggling responsibilities between being the overachieving daughter of the Mayor of Halcyon City and being Mirror, the superheroine from UMA. <br /><br />And it turns out, the mundane scenes also revealed more about the other player characters! Besides The Janus, we also had The Doomed, The Delinquent, The Nova, and The Outsider. During those mundane scenes, I tend to introduce an NPC like a family member (if they have a family) or someone who cares interacting with them. Or a solo scene where they can remove their conditions. They&#39;re all pretty short scenes but I usually give the spotlight to different players each session so some characters get longer mundane scenes than others. <br /><br />We had some really emotional, memorable scenes in our first session thanks to this structure, specifically from The Delinquent during a scene between him and his father. I&#39;ve never seen a group of players so focused while watching the scene unfold in front of them while tearing up silently. Like, even playing the asshole dad had me holding back tears and trying my best to not break character. One of my players literally said out loud after the scene &quot;I am so emotionally invested in this,&quot; and that made me so happy?? I&#39;ve never had a player say that before so that really meant a lot.<br /><br />Okay, anyway! The other thing that I borrowed from a different system was Bubblegumshoe&#39;s NPC creation. So NPC&#39;s have details such as:<br /><br />1. Nature/Tag (their relationship with the PC, either like/love/hate and what they think of them)<br />2. Thumbnail (a short sentence or phrase to describe them and what they do)<br />3. Trouble (a problem that they&#39;re facing/struggling with. E.g. The Nova&#39;s mother is really sick but hasn&#39;t told anyone)<br />4. Location (where can they be commonly found? E.g. UMA Headquarters, Mayor&#39;s office)<br /><br />I also give Influence, Drives, Moves, and Conditions for all important NPC&#39;s, not just villains because you never know who the kids are going to trigger a move on and if they&#39;ll end up fighting them, physically or socially. Important NPC&#39;s meaning the kids interact with them frequently or will be interacting with frequently (a rising villain). This is obviously A LOT of stuff to keep track off but I have a problem with remaining consistent when I&#39;m improvising so it helps to prepare these things early and have them on standby. Plus, I love fleshing out characters! <br /><br />That&#39;s all! What do you guys borrow from different systems? How does it help you? I&#39;d love to know and I hope what I&#39;ve shared is helpful somehow. Play more games!<br /><br /><br /><br />"

    "content": "Just wanted to share a current play by post game that&#39;s going pretty well and my current thoughts on playing this game with PbP.<br /><br />Team consists of:<br />Thor Girl (The Alien): who has come to our world to bring back the bonds between Asgardians and Earthlings.<br />Wingblade (The Protege): an experimented specimen whose who struggles between striking the balance between vicious combatant and new &#39;normal&#39; girl.<br />Hashtag (The Delinquent): jokester and tagger, has had some of the most sincere moments in the game thus far.<br />Bioshock (The Doomed): another case of terrible parents. His enhanced control of his body let&#39;s him push past the limits of humanity.<br />Bran the Blessed (The Janus): Young girl Bronwyn gained power and responsibility when she picked up a mythic spear and became the mighty man Bran.<br /><br />Had some great characters and players come and go for various reasons, but have learned a few lessons over the course of running this game in a PbP format.<br /><br />1. Encouraging the characters to make moves on their own will help speed up the game. If they make a move that you don&#39;t consider to be needed, don&#39;t argue with them. The player considers it needed for their character, so let the moment happen.<br /><br />2. There will always be a bit of retconning here and there. Example, the bad guy gets away but then a player will post that right before they got away, the character stopped it or left some lasting injury or effect. Overall, I once again tend to go along with the player, going off their writing and adding my own on to achieve my original intent or even change what was intended to give them the success. After all, what&#39;s a roleplaying game without the characters changing their destiny?<br /><br />3. The flowing narrative of combat is usually restricted to one to two actions per GM combat post. Otherwise, combat can get incredibly one-sided, or the more frequent posters will quickly overshadow those that don&#39;t have as much time to update their combat actions.<br /><br />4. Frequently! Ask! Questions!<br />    Since information can&#39;t be as easily shared as speaking with each other, asking for details often can help establish the world, characters, and current scenarios. Everything from how a costume looks, to what a character&#39;s feelings are on a recent event can be useful.<br /><br />That&#39;s the big stuff at least. I still have a lot to learn as a GM, and still hope to run this for an in-person group someday."

Anything in the rules you don&#39;t do for some reason?<br /><br />Thus far my prep has been just the post-first/second session stuff. The first session character/city creation ran the whole time and we couldn&#39;t do the mini-scene intro, so we did that first thing in the second, and then did the second session after a short break. So, what I&#39;ve done is made a relationship map and NPC list with little details that will help bring them together in various ways (Protege is the only known hero of the group and one of the other hero&#39;s younger siblings made his own action figure to go with the Mentor&#39;s figure that he already owned). I also made some initial labels various people in their lives will push, though it is just a loose guide. There are there are other small details I&#39;ve firmed up as well, but I&#39;m very interested in what the community tends to do between sessions as prep."

He was in the midst of transforming the girls into twisted ideas of beauty, one of the girls had already been transformed.  <br /><br />To save the other one and to make amends, Ava volunteered to take her place.  Dr. Pygmalion, for twisted reasons of his own, transformed her using chemical procedures to give her water absorption and projection powers channeled through her fat cells.  She gains weight the more she uses her powers, plus gain weight on her own normally.  When she resisted, he went as far as to similarly brainwash and transform her parents with a desire to let themselves grow to over 500# apiece themselves and encourage her to grow to her full potential, which Pygmalion set to 1000# for reasons of his own...<br /><br />My idea was she started as a Doomed.  With her final form, post-conquering her doom being a Transformed.<br /><br />Conceptually, how would you work a Transformed with this power structure using the Playbook?<br />"

    "content": "I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about how this game would run with certain comics I read, and I wanted to discuss the possibility of a Masks campaign for Adam Warren&#39;s Empowered.  (My fave book coming out these days. Read it.  Just not in public.)<br /><br />Granted, Emp and most of her associates are 20-somethings rather than teens, but the themes of defining oneself by other&#39;s perceptions, not belonging to the establishment, and growing into the person you want to be are all there.<br /><br />Emp herself certainly qualifies as a Beacon.  Sistah Spooky is a Doomed.  Beyond that, it&#39;s a little murky.  Thug Boy and Ninjette have elements of the Delinquent, the Reformed, and the Bull.  And any of the given antagonists--hero and villain--would be marvelous in the Masks system.<br /><br />Any fellow fans?  Thoughts?"

    "content": "<b>The Brain</b><br /><b>The Harbinger</b><br /><b>The Soldier</b><br /><br />I finally got a chance to take a look at the supplemental Playbooks through my Backer-kit.<br /><br />I have to say that I LOVE these three way more than the previous supplemental Playbooks that have been published. I&#39;m having a little trouble putting my finger on why but I think it&#39;s because these three much better represent the characters I thought I might see represented in the others. Also, these character archetypes resonate with me much better.<br /><br /><b>The Brain</b> is great at representing Tony Stark or Hank Pym, but I also think it does a 100% better job at representing Lex /Lena Luthor than the Reformed Playbook does. <br /><br /><b>The Soldier</b> is a Playbook I can identify with because one of the Masks characters I&#39;ve created, a Bull, would actually be much more aligned with the Soldier than with the Bull. You can also very clearly see the parallels between this Playbook and the cinematic Captain America, who is probably my favorite MCU character. This Playbook is also great for playing a character who is more like Colossus than Wolverine. It&#39;s amazing how a shift in attitude and perspective can totally distinguish Playbooks that could be virtually identical in other types of games. <br /><br /><b>The Harbinger</b> sings to me merely because Bishop is one of my top five favorite X-Men. And the parallels to Bishop and Cable is obvious, as is the inspiration from DCs Impulse and Booster Gold. <br /><br />I also like the new Labels they have for the Soldier and the Harbinger. The Harbinger can choose whether or not they come from a dark future they want to avert or a bright future they want to preserve and their actions force the Future to move in either direction. That&#39;s awesome! It&#39;s a great way to distinguish The Harbinger from the Doomed. It could have been a really easy fix to give the Harbinger an analogous &quot;Doom Track&quot; to represent their actions shaping and re-shaping the future. But they went with this Label instead. Very cool, very elegant solution and really makes you feel like you&#39;re playing someone who is impacting future imperfect history.<br /><br />The Solider has a label called Soldier. It represents your loyalty to, the resources of, and the training by AEGIS. You can use this Label instead of any other for your actions by spending a point from the Team Pool as long as you are acting on orders or relying on your training. The theme of this Label echoes some of the moves the Outsider has access to, representing their loyalty to their people and being on Earth for a specific mission, but once again, making it a Label instead of a bunch of moves really distinguishes who the Soldier is. <br /><br />And just so I don&#39;t leave out <b>The Brain.</b> They have their Shame... something they are responsible for that threatens something they care about. Also, part of the playing the Brain is a little bit of an attitude or haughtiness because you KNOW you&#39;re better than everyone else. This is what makes me think they are great representations for character that might otherwise be Reformed. Lex Luthor for example. But even someone like Emma Frost of the X-Men could be perfectly emulated with the Brain Playbook.<br /><br />On the flip side, the Brain is also THE Playbook for playing young Tony Stark, Brainiac 5 and (my favorite) <b>Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur!</b> This is why the Brain wins for me over the Joined playbook. Instead of powers or abilities, you chose something you are known for. The list includes things that immediately remind you of Otto Octavius, Tony Stark, Hank Pym and the like. Then they had in the list &quot;Robot Sidekick&quot; and my mind just edited to &quot;Dinosaur Sidekick&quot; and BAM! Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur can finally be played in a Masks game with no fuss, no muss!<br /><br />Beautiful.<br /><br />So, yeah, these new Playbooks are winning me over and I would always choose or recommend The Soldier, the Brain, or the Harbinger over the Reformed, the Star, the Joined, or the Newborn."

This is my first post, so apologies if this has been answered elsewhere, but a quick question. <br /><br />According to the rules, there seems to be a lot of leeway in terms of the Bull&#39;s abilities, as long as they focus on combat rather than utility. What I&#39;m curious about is whether or not an energy blast type of power is too flexible for the playbook.<br /><br />I was considering making a Bull based partially around Paige Rampling from Progenitor, who has a supremely tough permanent skintight force field and massive energy blasts that are tough to minimize damage."

This would be a character with his supernatural talent behind the wheel, and the rest of the team would be younger kids who don’t have their driver’s licenses yet.  You’d have to get the whole group to agree not to take any of the powers that make cars obsolete, I suppose, but the idea of the team carpooling everywhere in a borrowed station wagon with a team logo amateurishly stenciled on the front is too good - and too quintessentially Masks - to pass up.<br /><br />I wonder if retrofitting the vehicle rules (or perhaps the whole Driver playbook) from AW 2e would work?"

Unfortunately, the tower was destroyed, along with the homes of the android and the Doomed&#39;s best friend.<br /><br />Now they are on the hunt for The Disassembler, a destructive criminal who was sprung from the AEGIS transport vehicle by GridVolt, a powerful villain with powers to shut down systems and reflect attacks. The trail went cold last night when they found the computer that was blocking the Delinquent&#39;s searches, which had reflected her electronic-psychic blast back onto herself.<br /><br />Any thoughts on how to get them back on the trail?"

The onus is that the mask would be a character from the past (anything from the Stone Age to the Silver Age is fair play) that&#39;s been brought to the modern day, who is unfamiliar with modern social and technological conventions, but whose heroic spirit means that they&#39;re going to go forth and do good in spite of it. If you need an example, Captain America&#39;s the big one, but TVTropes has a big section on it under &quot;Fish out of Temporal Water&quot;.<br /><br />What would be a good, catchy name for this playbook? What moves would work for it? Is there anything this type of character would need that I may not be thinking of?<br /><br />(As of right now, the main mechanic is &quot;Curiosities&quot; - a list of modern things that the playbook finds noteworthy - which could equally mean fascinating, terrifying, or a bane to society, depending on the character. How these work mechanically is something I&#39;m still hammering out.) "

Still in the introduction, you know how PbP games go, but everyone is super into their characters and I can&#39;t wait to see where things go!<br /><br />The team I&#39;ve got to work with is pretty neat:<br />-Kaiju, the Transformed: the 13 year old (former) heir to Kujira Industries who suffered a freak mutation, and intriguingly enough managed to become the de facto leader of this band of misfits. Basically looking to make a good name for himself to counteract the bad press he&#39;s received since his transformation. Looks something like a humanoid orca.<br />-Ssirana-115, the Outsider: an alien clone from Mars in a parallel universe... who also happens to be about six inches tall. Uses a human sized biomechanical suit to do superheroing in the most creative application of the Kirbycraft move I&#39;ve seen.<br />-Anti-Venom, the Janus: a girl who learned she really shouldn&#39;t mess around with her sisters collection of possibly magical ancient Egyptian artifacts. Has magically endowed physical abilities, as well as a venomous bite and thermal vision. Plays as something of an adorable cross between Spiderman, Batman, and a cobra.<br />-Max Leather, CHALLENGER OF THE UNKNOWN, the Legacy: the latest in a line of heroes who insist the genre of their universe is pulp science fiction, and damn anyone else who says otherwise. Peak human physically, and genius intellect, what&#39;s not to love? Apart from the lack of social skills due to growing up on a space station that is.<br />-Luminous Wing, the Star: A kid with wings and a flare for the dramatic. Basically a kid who started a vlog that took off, but who genuinely wants to be a hero and be a part of this team. Nobody knows how he got the wings, and he&#39;s smart about teasing his audience with that.<br /><br />We actually don&#39;t have an official name for the team yet. Any ideas? It can be serious or embarrassing, I&#39;m kinda trying to make a running joke that the media can&#39;t come up with good superhero names and titles to save their lives :P"

A player who consistently chooses to grab or subdue enemies with their rolls and if they haven&#39;t rolled well enough they choose &quot;avoid blows&quot; to keep themself ready to attempt it again. They never really try to do anything with the environment/using words until they&#39;ve &quot;grappled&quot; the enemy into submission. They also generally have super strength/speed as a power so explaining how an enemy escapes their grip either feels cheap or causes arguments.<br /><br />Once in a while it&#39;s alright, but when it&#39;s the ONLY action they take it brings the game to a screeching halt and other players start to feel useless. How would you suggest this be handled? Talking to the player privately? I&#39;d rather not go the route of making all the enemies be teleporting mist-monsters..."

In other games, I&#39;d hand everyone a Fate / Drama / Hero point. Should I award Team for that? <br /><br />Lastly, I know that one could easily make the YJ Team with playbooks, but I&#39;m fuzzy on making villains. Has anyone thrown together villain cards for the various villains in YJ, just so I can get a handle on how to adapt the fiction to the rules? The Villain Deck is awesome but I&#39;m not sure how Rampage (Villain Deck) compares to Solomon Grundy or the Abomination. "

Usually you secret identity types lean on the whole &#39;keep my loved ones safe&#39; thing pretty hard.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Not really a concern for me.&quot; Erin half-smiled, staring down at the floor between her feet. &quot;And I don&#39;t see how lying to is supposed to keep anybody safe, anyway.&quot;<br /><br />Gemini leaned forward. &quot;So why the mask? You know, if you don&#39;t mind sharing... Bearing in mind I&#39;ve saved your life twice now, just sayin&#39;.&quot;<br /><br />Erin was quiet for a long moment before looking up. &quot;I&#39;ve done... some pretty bad stuff. To other people. And I didn&#39;t even give it a second thought before, but after that thing with the Medusa...&quot;<br /><br />Her voice trembled for a moment, and her hands tightened into fists in her lap. After a moment, she continued, her voice steady. &quot;After <i>that,</i> I got a taste of what being helpless felt like. So I&#39;m trying to do better. To <i>be</i> better. And if people knew who I was–&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It would sully your heroic reputation?&quot; Gemini cut in.<br /><br />Erin half-shrugged. &quot;Well, yeah, that too. But the big thing is that if I want to make up for all the stuff I&#39;ve done, I have to do it as <i>me.</i> As Erin, not as The Golem. And if people knew we were the same person, they might think that the stuff I do out here somehow absolves me of all the stuff I did back there. And then, I might start to think that, too.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I just...&quot; She rubbed the back of her neck, looking for the words. &quot;I want this part of my life to be a choice, not a &#39;get out of responsibility free&#39; card. You know?&quot;<br /><br />Gemini stared back at her for a long moment, then leaned back into the couch with a satisfied nod. &quot;Yeah, I think that settles it.&quot;<br /><br />Erin raised an eyebrow. &quot;Settles what?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I was all prepped to talk you into going home. Had this whole speech planned out.&quot; She puffed out her chest and put on a stern voice. &quot;&#39;You really want to keep your loved ones safe, don&#39;t go out and pick fights with supervillains.&#39;&quot;<br /><br />&quot;...And now?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Now,&quot; Gemini smirked, her eyes twinkling. &quot;I can see you&#39;re too broody to go home no matter what anyone tells you. So I&#39;m going to teach you everything I know about this life... and maybe next time you can handle a bush-league bank robbery on your own.&quot;<br /><br />She leaned forward, offering her hand. &quot;Deal?&quot;<br /><br />Erin stared across at her, and after a moment&#39;s hesitation, shook her hand. &quot;Deal.&quot;<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Prepping for <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23NaNoWriMo/posts\">#NaNoWriMo</a>. Don&#39;t know if this scene will play out exactly like this, but I&#39;m trying to get into the characters&#39; heads. I&#39;m going to try and prep instead of pants this year, we&#39;ll see how it goes!<br /><br />I don&#39;t have a title yet, but the story is about a high school bully who gets abducted by a supervillain and ends up with powers as a result. The experience makes her reevaluate and try to redeem herself, and as she&#39;s reforging her identity her freshman superhero efforts also get her involved in an intricate web of villainy.<br /><br />For posterity, she&#39;s based on a Masks character I never got to play: a Janus whose mundane obligations and opportunities were focused on that path of redemption rather than just being a way to complicate her superhero actions. The villain who abducted her turned her to stone, and she was eventually able to turn herself back when her powers manifested; now she can turn to stone and back at will, as well as speak to earth and stone.<br /><br />Gemini is also a character I didn&#39;t get to play much, though she&#39;s a bit older and was in the Valiant system. She&#39;s kind of a mix of Firestorm and Green Lantern; she&#39;s psychically and physiologically bonded with an alien creature of living light and has a variety of light-based powers as a result. She is laid back bordering on lazy, and may or may not be a terrible role model for our young heroine.<br /><br />I&#39;m still cementing the cast, but there may be a few more unplayed and barely-played characters among them. They need a home!"

I am getting ready to run a Masks game, and i would like it to have a &quot;Boku no hero academy&quot; vibe, let me explain with the pitch:<br /><br />&quot;In halcyon city, there&#39;s a highschool built to train the next generation of superheroes. This highschool is set on high standards, and not everyone can fit the requirements to go here. Here, they will learn how to work on team, use their powers and be a real hero. In teams of 3, they will  be tested all days, in order to get ready for the real world out there.<br /><br />Every team of heroes in the city is watching for this new generation. They don&#39;t have a name yet. They are the new generation. This is their story.&quot; <br /><br />So, i was thinking about mixing this highschool thing with their personal stories coming out of their booklets, in order to bolster the identity issue without forgetting the battles and being a hero. <br /><br />Could this work? How should i prepare for my first session then? Could i make a villain that is a teacher on this school testing them?  Help me, please!"

I also decided that both villains would have been coerced into this attack by Shadow&#39;s nemesis, a dark wizard.<br /><br />The fight started in the park, with the villains trying to get inside the adjacent &quot;History of Science&quot; museum for an unrevealed reason.  It was rough for the wildcards at first, but Exo and Glimmer managed to trap Rampage in a sculpture while ATLAS, Sol, and Shadow put a lot of dents in Iron Flag.  When a villain&#39;s monologue revealed that Shadow&#39;s nemesis was behind this, Shadow used his dark vision doom sign to learn exactly what the bad-guys were after.<br /><br />Since I hadn&#39;t included any of Sol&#39;s backstory yet, I decided that the villains&#39; goal was something from her people&#39;s homeworld.  Sol&#39;s player decided it was a probe sent to Earth, the first contact between Humans and her species.<br /><br />And when he learned this, Shadow decided that the probe must be destroyed so that his nemesis couldn&#39;t acquire it.  Not only did he destroy the probe, he also used his doom sign powers to crush what was left of Iron Flag like a soda can.<br /><br />So Sol the Alien got to see her teammate destroy an important artifact of her people, while ATLAS the robot got to see his teammate destroy a robotic being without any hint of remorse.  Normally after that intro fight, my Masks one-shots go to NPCs showing up and cheering the team for their heroics and/or berating them for their failures--but this time, the fallout was all internal to the team.  Somber reflections on the price paid in desperate situations, New grim lessons on what humanity was capable of for the non-human members of the team."

Iwant to talk about a great thing that the other players have served up to me. They have been really hitting on a cool dynamic: they are innocent at heart, and they don&#39;t think my Reformed is.  So they serve innocent statements up for me to shoot down, or they put me down for my dark/cruel attitude and I always let it wound me.  Really great, exactly what the playbook needs from my fellow players.<br /><br />Here&#39;s two examples from our first session of play:<br /><br />I.  I contact Lovelace, a Friend in Low Places, specialty: insider info, for something or other. We roleplay it out, I mark Obligation, etc.  As we are (flirting and) wrapping it up, the Doomed jumps in and asks Lovelace about his obsession.  &quot;Suuuure,&quot; she says.  &quot;I can help you with that, if in return...&quot; <br /><br />I interrupt, &quot;No! No, just, don&#39;t, just deal with me! I&#39;ll handle it. Whatever it is, I&#39;ll do it.&quot;  I end up marking Obligation again. The other characters who are looking on the conversation conclude, &quot;oh, the Reformed is trying to keep secrets from us and keep this useful resource away from us&quot;.  To my character, though, all he can think is &quot;the Doomed has enough problems, the last thing he needs is to sink into the quagmire of owing all these dangerous, crazy people favors.&quot;  Which is SUCH a comic book misunderstanding, and it will certainly drive a lot of events around and around as we go forward!<br /><br />II.  I lashed out at the Transformed during the battle. She gets me back after. So when things calm down, we are trying to support each other. I say &quot;Hey, do you want to blow off steam?&quot;  She goes &quot;YEAH! Let&#39;s go get FRAPPUCINOS!!&quot; and I say &quot;NO!! Let&#39;s go throw bricks through a human traffickers car window!! I know where he PARKS!&quot; She got this great, hesitant, fearful look on her face and went &quot;.....yesss???&quot;  And it ended up meaning something that she was willing to go along with my petty vandalism, even though it was petty. Maybe even more significant for its pettiness.<br /><br />So I guess I would say the Reformed is working great for me, <span class=\"proflinkWrapper\"><span class=\"proflinkPrefix\">+</span><a class=\"proflink\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/104242213536336786514\" oid=\"104242213536336786514\">Brendan Conway</a></span>.

We&#39;ve established pretty clearly that is his Doom which will happen when he takes the advance or finishes filling his doom track the requisite number of times.<br /><br />We originally thought that his Nemesis was the Great Old Trickster, but are increasingly wondering if we&#39;re doing this right.  Should the Nemesis be tied in that tightly to the Doom?  I know the Nemesis is meant to be a constant push that makes you do your powers, so does it not make sense for the creature that is hunting you to be the nemesis as well?<br /><br />We were playing with an agent of the Great Old Trickster or a human-form of it or something, but are increasingly concerned we&#39;re going the wrong direction!"

There has been a lot of disagreement about this at my table and some of the people (Including the GM) thinks the concept feels wonky, and it seems like the most mechanically powerful method of using the rules. To the point where I don&#39;t see the point in giving up your influence in literally any other way. One of the worst ways that A villain can hurt your team is with this move so there is literally not a reason to do otherwise. <br /><br />Also it seems like the situation causes both the Influencer and influencee to receive benefits. The one using their influence to take advantage gets what they want (You to not fail the Roll and keep fighting) and the Influencee gets the added benefit of passing the roll and not having to worry about influence from the original character anymore. In the other cases of this rule it seems like only the Influencer gains any benefit with the Influencee being high and dry or feeling pretty shitty about the whole thing.<br /><br />Also, It seems like taking advantage of your influence over someone is generally speaking not very helpful otherwise. Inflicting a condition doesn&#39;t guarantee a result on other PCs, taking +1 on one roll seems pretty useless when compared to just keeping the +1 roll all the time and risking not having the bonus at a critical point in the future."

This affects the scene and the heroes and sometimes means a move doesn&#39;t trigger. <br /><br />Last session my players went up against one of the A-listers of Halcyon&#39;s villains, the powerful sorceress Morigan Lefaye. <br /><br />The Bull and the Janus both rushed to attack her and I had her catch them out of the air and throw them both back and to the ground with a dismissive gesture. <br /><br />When the Legacy lasso&#39;d her with a chain, she spoke a magic word and electrified herself and the chain, shocking him. <br /><br />She turned the Doomed into a raven. Now they have to find a way to break the spell.<br /><br />Of these 3, only the last one was as a result of having the villain react to a failed move. The first 2 I just described happen in response to my what my players said their characters were doing. I know both my Bull and Janus were trying to directly engage, but I didn&#39;t think it would come to that and instead had Morigan counter their attacks. <br /><br />Is this right? In my mind, this <b>seems</b> right. Some villains with certain abilities will be tough or downright impossible to engage with in certain ways. It doesn&#39;t matter how strong you are, if all you do is punch, you&#39;re not directly engaging the amorphous water-monster. Try as hard as you may, no amount of unleashing your ferrokinetic powers are gonna create a cage that traps a person who can freely teleport - it isn&#39;t a roll. This is kinda how I&#39;ve been thinking when these things happen.<br /><br />I don&#39;t want to break the rules or be a jerk to my players.<br />Thoughts?"

    "content": "I&#39;m coming up on my 10th session of my game, and I had an idea for how to start it. So, my players seem to greatly enjoy the more personally focused stuff much more than the standard superhero antics. When I introduce traditional super fights, they tend to sort of get glossed over to move on to the things that drive the characters. The conflicts that involve those things obviously get more love, but I found that the big team fights tend to go very fast.<br /><br />In my last session, a threat that the PCs have been pursuing since the beginning of the game (and strengthening with research and bad rolls), finally got a chance to make a move, and the short term result is that the major super team, the Guardians, have been taken out of commission for a week. As a result, the kids are being forced to step up and handle the Guardians threats for a week.<br /><br />Now, building an arc for them and getting thought it would probably not work, with their greater enjoyment of the more personal stories going on. This would clearly be a side-quest rather than the focus of the game. If I made it the focus of the whole session, it wouldn&#39;t go quite as well. So I have an idea of what to do for this to give them that story but move them on to the stuff they&#39;re more invested in fairly quickly.<br /><br />My idea is to start the session at the end of the traditional 6 issue comic book arc of the characters dealing with this threat. I will define one or two supervillains who are taking advantage of the situation of downed Guardians. At the start of the session, the PCs have just turned that corner from being out-gunned/out-maneuvered and have just turned the tables. The start will be the end of that arc, so to speak.<br /><br />My current plan is to have the primary foe be the nemesis of the Legacy, with a second they&#39;ve teamed up with, that I might leave up to the PCs to define. Might even add another, to make a more Injustice League type group.<br /><br />I intend to have the players define the way the whole arc happened. I was thinking of asking questions much like the &quot;When the team first got together&quot; with questions about the enemy&#39;s plans, how the enemy got the upper hand, how the PCs turned the tables, etc. If I ask them to build the story, they will naturally be more invested in it, we can tie the enemies into their stories in their own ways, and I think it&#39;ll be neat. Even if it&#39;s a one-time thing, I think it&#39;s an experiment worth trying.<br /><br />I would appreciate any suggestions as to questions to ask, and how to approach them. Do I ask specific questions of each playbook, like the team origin questions? Do I just prepare a list of questions that I throw out and let them hash them out one at a time?<br /><br />Please note that while this might seem to circumvent the general view of how the game plays out, I know my players and what they enjoy. Also, this is the session that the Doomed is likely to face the doom on their own terms, but I don&#39;t just want to drop the Week Without Guardians idea for that story. So trying to highlight the world part quickly to move towards the personal as soon as possible.<br /><br />"

I&#39;ve seen some comments around the board that multiple concurrent arcs are less common in people&#39;s Masks games (compared to other pbta games), which has been the opposite of my experience, so I was curious."

    "content": "I&#39;ve got a question about character knowledge and the Assess the Situation move.  When a player uses Assess the Situation, how much do you take the character&#39;s personal knowledge into account?<br /><br />Last night my group was facing a highly advanced alien robotic lifeform. Our Delinquent, who is 100% human, has a low level of education, and has never been to space or dealt with anything more advanced than a smart phone rolled to Assess and decided to ask how to break this super advanced cage made by the super advanced alien robot.  She rolled an 11 and I didn&#39;t really want to say &quot;you have no idea&quot;, cause she had a good roll, so I ended up waffling some response that honestly sounded like BS to me.  <br /><br />But at the same time, the team does have an alien (the Outsider) and a cybernetically enhanced person (the Transformed) who would have had knowledge relevant to this particular question.  And I was a little sad to not give them the opportunity to use it for this particular obstacle.<br /><br />Should I have stuck to my first instinct, which was to say &quot;you have no idea&quot; and give the other two members the opportunity to put their knowledge to use?  Or is it better to reward the player for a successful roll, even if it requires a bit of a stretch?  "

It seems it is implied that a pair of hooks push/pull the same labels.<br /><br />Any experience on using hook pairs ? There is mechanically a back-and-forth between two labels, and from the experience I had it feels like we are going in circles (and I have heard that from other people). <br />If only one label is common, it seems it will help move the character somewhere: for example a Legacy unsure of his ego could have NPC1 +Superior/-Savior and NPC2 +Mundane/-Superior and then have an incentive (mechanical and fictional) to find a NPC who will help keep his Savior up and/or Mundane down ?<br /><br />Most of the times I have GMed, I haven&#39;t planned specific labels to be push/pulled by specific NPC: I have just let the fiction speak for itself and I went with the wind as far as choosing which label to pull. I feel like I am missing something great.  I would greatly appreciate any input on the use of hooks from experienced GMs of Masks :)<br />"

His Apartment Building&#39;s Janitor) But he hasn&#39;t received Any In-Game Benefits for it, I decided to make it more general if I need to use it for someone else.<br /><br />When you train with an older Hero as time Passes, Roll <b>+The Label they wish to impose on you</b>, Hold one <b>Train</b>, And they either <b>Take Influence over you</b> or attempt to <b>Shift Your Labels</b>. On A miss, it doesn&#39;t go as well as you would hope, Mark a condition, Your Choice, and say what went wrong. On a 7-9 Choose one boon, on a 10+ Choose 2.<br />-They don&#39;t happen to give you any lectures this time, They don&#39;t <b>Take Influence over you</b> or attempt to <b>Shift Your Labels</b><br />-The session is especially helpful, Hold an extra <b>Train</b><br />-You are feeling especially good about yourself and you feel you have grown into your image of yourself more, Shift one label up and one down, your choice<br /><br />You May spend <b>Train</b> at any Time To do any of the following: <br />-Remember Your Practice of the very thing you are now doing and use it to gain an edge, When <b>Unleashing your powers</b> or <b>Directly engaging a threat</b> Gain a +1 after rolling as Though you spent a Team from the pool on your own move.<br />-Have words of encouragement from your Trainer come Back to you when you need them most, <b>Clear a Condition</b> Or Subtract 2 from your roll to <b>Take a Powerful blow</b> as though you spent 2 team from the pool<br />-Recognize and exploit a former mistake of yours someone else just made, Take <b>+1 Forward</b> against them for the rest of the scene, <b>Take influence over them</b>, Or <b>Provoke Them</b> to action as though you rolled a flat Seven(Still factor in labels or conditions afterward.)<br />-You Remember something useful your Trainer said about the person you are facing right now(Or people like them if they don&#39;t know of this person), Chose one extra option(Even on a miss) When <b>Assessing a situation</b> they are causing Or <b>Piercing their Mask</b>.<br />-After succeeding at something: Remember How much you struggled during training to do what you just did, <b>Mark Potential</b> or <b>add a team to the Pool</b><br />-Remember and accept Something your Trainer said about who you are or how the world works, <b>Reject the Influence</b> Of anyone other than them or Comfort/Support, anyone, as though you rolled a 7-9.  But next time your trainer  <b>Tells you who you are or how the world works</b> take a -2 against if you attempt to reject their influence, after all, their advice WAS helpful last time.<br /><br /><b>NOTE: Train Persists between sessions and scenes</b><br /><br />Any Feedback is very much appreciated to refine/improve this move as it is still a rough draft."

The Outsider moves imply an alien origin, so we reskinned them to be more appropriate. Here they are, for anyone who&#39;s interested.<br /><br /><b>The unseen world</b>: You can commune with other departed ghosts. Whenever you contact the unseen realm, roll +Superior. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 2. On a miss, hold 1, but those beyond make an uncomfortable demand. Spend your hold 1 for 1 to:<br />- receive a cursed or spiritually potent item that will allow you to use any ability from another playbook once (choose the ability when you spend the hold)<br />- consult the memories of the departed to ask the GM a question about the current situation<br />- clear a condition through the comfort of contact with your home<br /><br /><b>Possession</b>: When you touch a mortal object and empower it, roll +Freak. On a hit, you can use this object as a focus to do something impossible. When you roll a 10+, choose one:<br />- it works exceptionally well<br />- you get an additional use out of it<br />On a miss, the focus is effective, but it has a completely unintended side effect that the GM will reveal when you use it.<br /><br /><b>The past is a foreign country</b>: Whenever you openly disregard or undermine an modern era custom in favor of one of your own era&#39;s customs, shift Superior up and any other Label down.<br /><br /><b>Fetters</b>: You have a set of physical fetters, some otherwise mundane items with special emotional significance to you such as a pocket watch or painting. Detail their history, and choose two strengths and weaknesses. When your fetters are present in the scene, you can use them to unleash your powers, directly engage a threat, or defend someone using Superior.<br /><br /><i>Strengths</i>: Very portable, very concealable, usable as weapon, easily fixable, can shift between mundane and spirit world, can be used at a distance<br /><i>Weaknesses</i>: Requires ritual to empower, susceptible to <i>______</i>, easily detectable, big and clumsy, difficult to repair<br /><br /><b>In good spirits</b>: When you comfort or support someone by telling them how they exemplify the best parts of the modern world, roll +Freak instead of +Mundane.<br /><br /><b>History lesson</b>: When you talk about your home time and place, roll +Freak. On a 10+, choose two. On a 7-9, choose one. During the conversation, you:<br />- confess a flaw of your home; add 1 Team to the pool<br />- mislead them about your home; take Influence over them<br />- describe the glories of your home; clear a condition<br />On a miss, you inadvertently reveal more about yourself than you planned; tell them a secret or vulnerability you haven’t shared with the living before now."

    "content": "So I&#39;m having a great time with masks as a GM narrative wise but I&#39;m having a hard time using it mechanically for combat and social interactions.<br /><br />Both me and my players are starting to feel like it&#39;s getting stale mechanically and I&#39;m kind of at a loss on how to freshen it up. We&#39;ve been playing for several months now and the group is good in the stories fun but all our combat seem to go the same way. The challenge is setup player 1:assesses the situation. player 2: directly engages the threat. Player 3: directly engages a threat or defense&#39;s one of the other players. players 1or2: use Playbook move. Player4:finishes it by unleashing powers,directly engaging a threat, or rolling defend to save civilians. sometimes someone might Pierce The Mask  but that&#39;s rare. that turns into our whole combat usually. <br /><br />They usually don&#39;t fail any of they&#39;re rolls and by usually I mean 95% of the time. The only time they take a powerful blow is when they choose not to resist the blow from the bad guy but then they always succeed at taking a powerful blow so it doesn&#39;t affect the players at all. They also always succeed when it comes to resisting influence when they choose to. Story-wise I&#39;ll say bad guy does X and they&#39;ll just stop them mechanically which means they stop them narratively. In the end my villains conditions get filled up fast.<br /><br />granted there a lot of really good story elements that players deal with outside the combat but it just feels like there is no mechanical challenge in the game.<br /><br />Is anyone else having this problem? <br /><br />Do players just usually fail more of there rolls so people don&#39;t have this problem?<br />Should I focus less on mechanical conflict and more on narrative conflict in battle? <br />Do I create my own mechanical moves and interact more mechanically even though the players succeed? <br />most of my villain moves tend to be narrative. villain one gets punched in the nose so they throw rocks at civilians, put a hero in danger or ratchet up the verbal aggression towards the hero. is that right or should I be creating moves that I&#39;m going to roll for that can hurt the players mechanically?<br /><br />sorry if this post seems rambling but I just thought I would see what people&#39;s thoughts were and what their experiences were and whether or not I could get some pointers on what I might be doing wrong.<br />"

    "content": "I just ran Masks reskinned for fantasy over the weekend.  Mostly I just changed the names of the &quot;back stories&quot;  and some of the moves.  (&quot;Dragon&quot;, &quot;Fated&quot;, &quot;Hero&quot;, &quot;Trickster&quot;, &quot;Weapon&quot;, &quot;Protege&quot;, &quot;Other&quot;, &quot;Outsider&quot;, &quot;Hidden&quot; and &quot;Paragon&quot;.  The main difference was that I didn&#39;t want to emphasis &quot;teen&quot;, so I was loose with Influence and treated it more like Respect.<br /><br />The PCs were members of a Kibbutz-inspired group of settlers.  In the time of their great-grandfathers, the Landsmen had beaten back the dragons and started the settlement.  In the past few years, Orc raiders had moved in and tensions mounted.  The situation was that the Landsmen had recently achieved a Pyrrhic victory over the Orcs, and were now working for peace.  In play, the Orc leaders were divided, the Orcs themselves were insulting and arrogant,  and there were Landsmen prisoners of war being abused as servants.  Lots of reasons not to make peace, but they ultimately did to save their community.<br /><br />It was planned as a one-shot (so that no-one had to commit to more before knowing anything about it), but I was glad to hear talk that they might want more.  People were definitely frustrated about having their labels shifted (You moved my stats!), but I think they started to get more used to it in the end.  In particular, they are a mostly D&amp;D group, so they weren&#39;t really used to thinking about small scenes of interaction about comforting each other or opening up about fears.  "

She&#39;s not out to any of her teammates and worked really hard to stay that way even in the face of a provocative Bull who suspects that his masked rival and the girl he knows from school are the same person.<br /><br />It&#39;s clear from the way this session was going that her reluctance to share her identity with any of her teammates is a great source of potential drama for us to explore going forward--So i ended with a cliffhanger to highlight that.  As the four other members of the team were hanging out with the Janus who they didn&#39;t know was their teammate, enjoying their triumph over the ghostly hospital, the Janus&#39;s masked identity shows up, greets her teammates, and apologizes for missing the fun.  Cue in-character surprise from Janus and out-of-character surprise from all of the players.<br /><br />I&quot;m looking forward to next week as they unravel the mystery of this doppelganger."

What implications do you think this has, in play?<br /><br />As far as i can tell, it&#39;s very hard to get influence back (or have I missed something), so it would seem to me to be fairly common for the first adult that the Protoge doesn&#39;t listen to is their mentor."

They are school-age girls who gained elemental superpowers through an alien drug, and have decided to use their powers as villains for a while, until they get caught. Then they plan to use the exposure and notoriety for fame and fortune in the entertainment industry. Sort of the Halcyon City version of putting out a sex tape to get famous. Be a villain, get caught, sell the rehabilitation/redemption process as a reality show, then release an album.<br /><br />I haven&#39;t decided whether to give them one set of moves or give them individual moves. Deep down, I don&#39;t consider them an important part of the story for the PCs, just a view into the world of modern era heroes and villains while they fret over the very deep hole they&#39;ve dug themselves in with a clandestine government agency."

    "content": "<b>Fictional nature of Villain Conditions</b><br /><br />How important have you all found it to have the villain conditions be literally reflected in play?  For example, if you check Guilty for a villain, is it really important for them to be obviously fictionally guilty?  I get the connection to the specific list of triggered moves, and how that is important.  But is it enough to just show the move that is triggered in the fiction?<br /><br />I&#39;m asking because for tonight&#39;s game I&#39;m think big robot.  Big robot feels no literal emotions.  Can things that feel no emotions even be threats with conditions?  That seems like a silly question, but it wouldn&#39;t be the first time the obvious answer from past experience from other games would not apply to a specific PbtA game.  Also the rules seem pretty clear about the connection between checking a condition and the villain&#39;s internal emotional state.  For example: pg 158 - &quot;Mark Guilty for a villain if they understand the terrible nature of the things they do, but aren’t sure what else they can do.&quot;"

Do you keep the labels locked when you switch playbooks or unlock them and essentially start over?

How hard do you think it would be to adapt Masks to something more urban fantasy, dealing with the children of gods instead of superheroes? Kind of a Percy Jackson or teenage Scions game. There&#39;d be a shift in tone, I think, but it seems to me that most of the mechanics of young, larger than life teenagers finding themselves in a world of crazy powers would shift over with only a mild repainting. Your Janus is pulled between a mortal life and the world of demigods, instead of masks and civilians. Your Protege has a hands-on parent or mentor spirit. Your Delinquent is the child of a trickster god, perhaps? The standouts as likely to be more difficult would be the Beacon and the Transformed, who would probably need a bit more effort to adapt. Anyway, what do you folks think?"

I&#39;m looking for players who rather fail telling an interesting story than win telling a boring story.  <br /><br />The one-shot will be heavily improvised to allow us to personalise the story for your characters. There will be times where I hand creative control to you with questions like &#39;why is X mad at you?&#39;  This is not laziness.  This is not a trap.  This is a chance to tell the table more about your character and set up their relationship with X. <br /><br /><br />Inclusive to LGBT+, all races and religions etc.<br />I&#39;m new to the system myself but read the rules, watched live plays and feel confident with the mechanics.  I&#39;m usually a heavy planner (but that&#39;s dnd and a campaign so....kind of have to be).<br /><br />PM me on roll 20 if interested.<br /><a href=\"https://app.roll20.net/lfg/listing/82638/masks\" class=\"ot-anchor\">https://app.roll20.net/lfg/listing/82638/masks</a>",

    "content": "Thinking of writing a hack/expansion of Masks with adult playbooks tentatively called &#39;No City for Old Capes&#39;. It will be about what comes after you&#39;ve really had your moment of truth and more or less cemented who you are at your heart. A focus more on how you try to change the city and its inhabitants, and how you&#39;ve chosen to interact with them on YOUR terms. It is just in the brainstorming stage, so I&#39;m working on Playbooks and would like your opinion on the ones I&#39;ve thought up  so far:<br />- The Family Man (Handling your obligations, taken to the next level, each choice in the field can positively or negatively effect those you care about. How do you keep at it, knowing that you may be putting them in danger?)<br />- The God (You ARE superior to humanity in nearly every way and every time you&#39;ve tried to fix them, they screw it up. How do you handle being a perfect being in a imperfect world?) <br />- The Bridge (All about keeping up a positive relationship between earth and your home. How do you make each side understand each other?)<br />- The Monster (You can&#39;t go back to thinking you are still human, but you can still keep the damage you cause to a minimum... Right?)<br />- The Comeback (You were forgotten or disgraced, but you are going to show you are still relevant in this city. How will you get back in the spotlight?)<br />- The Mentor (You can mold the next generation if they give you a chance,  but push to hard and or too soft and they will push back. Can you you find the right balancd to teach them right?)<br />- The Activist (You&#39;ve taken up a cause and know it will help the world if others take it up. How do you navigate the press and alter public opinion?)<br />- The Retiree (Something happened to bring you out of retirement, and you aren&#39;t very happy about it. What do you have to do to solve the problem and get back out of the business?)<br /><br />What do you think? Is it a futile attempt to try to shoehorn in a concept? Is this better handled with Masks as is? What playbooks, themes, moves, etc would you like to see represented?"

    "content": "Many of the characters in the attached image represent a new/different character archetype. The X-Men from the past - as teens - where brought forward to the present. They are silver age heroes out of step with their own generation, but they are not of the current generation who are their peers. Also, Jean and Scott have to deal with their adult versions having gone pretty dark and hurt people - something they haven&#39;t done yet and might never do (temporal mechanics and all).<br /><br />Maybe &quot;The Returned&quot; would be a good name for the archetype. They are like Legacies in that they have history to confront, but they are their own Legacy! They are like Outsiders, but they are from Earth (at least an Earth). I think the interaction between the generations for this archetype could be very interesting too. They are still teens, but practically from a different world than their teammates. <br /><br />Other possible examples of the archetype could be...<br />- The Jean Grey story where she was in stasis while the Phoenix pretended to be her for years (if she had been a younger when she entered stasis)<br />- Bucky Barnes as the Winter Soldier after the brain washing and if he had been a teen instead of an adult (he was frozen as an early teen in the comic, don&#39;t know why he was an adult when he came back)<br />- The new Superboy while Superman was dead (he didn&#39;t have the memories, but close enough)<br /><br />So let me restate and add to the possible backstory ideas. For all of these we start with a Gold or Silver age hero...<br />...that went bad/dark and then a version of them as a teen is brought to the present day (from the past or an alternate reality)<br />...was frozen in time as a teen hero, replaced by a doppelganger, and only unfrozen after the doppelganger was killed<br />...dies but is cloned; the clone has all the memories of the hero as a teen <br />...dies but someone has raised their secret child in a detailed simulation of their early years in order to replace them<br />...that was brain scanned as a teen and the scan is used to make an android with all of their memories and real emotions<br /><br />Or, a Gold or Silver age villain that is taken from the past or an alternate universe before they turned evil, taught to be a hero instead, and is now in present day Halcyon City.<br /><br />You get the idea now. They are teens in the wrong era that need to live down or live up to or break away from preconceived ideas of who they are. They are a bridge to a previous generation (but never bronze - too recent).<br /><br />This seems ripe for a playbook to me. It feels pretty different from the standard playbooks and like it would have opportunities for unique interactions inside and outside the team. But I&#39;ve only played the game once and don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m ready to make a playbook.<br /><br />Also I think this might become a trope in comics as we have so many generations and legacies to play with - we love nostalgia!<br /><br />So if you have any ideas on this one or know where there is already a playbook that does this, please reply!<br />",

Going to have fun with this guy.<br /><br /><b>Axle</b> (Reformed)<br /><br />15-year-old Axle was raised and trained by his father, <i>Talon</i>; an infamous and unscrupulous mercenary. His harsh training regime was aimed at beating out any weakness and compassion, and forging Axel into a ruthless and remorseless killing machine. As Talon&#39;s apprentice, Axle worked alongside him for a number of years following Red Thursday, the disastrous battle that left many heroes dead and large parts of Chicago in ruins six years ago.<br /><br />Talon would have succeeded in moulding Axle in his image if it wasn&#39;t for the fact in the middle of a battle, Axle discovered that he had been lied to for years. Talon was not his father, in fact, Talon had murdered Axle&#39;s father during Red Thursday and abducted the hero&#39;s 9-year-old son, Alex. As part of a sick and twisted plan of revenge against the hero, Talon brainwashed Alex to forget who he was and transformed him into Axle. He turned on Talon and sided with the mask-wearing telepathy Melody and the half-plant mutant Anaconda.<br /><br />The two teenage &quot;heroes&quot; were trying to stop Rex Mason, a corrupt property magnate from driving out the residents of a decrepit apartment block to make way for a luxury development. Mason hired Talon and his apprentice to clear out any squatters and crush any opposition. During the battle, which resulted in the complete destruction of a nearby luxury condo still under construction, Melody reached into Axle&#39;s mind and recovered the memory of the night of his father&#39;s murder and his subsequent abduction.<br /><br />After the battle, Axle, Melody and Anaconda made their home in an underground hideout beneath an abandoned stadium, the former secret lair of a fallen supervillain.<br /><br /><b>Abilities</b><br />Thanks Talon&#39;s tutelage, Axle is skilled in a variety of weapons and martial techniques. Even without superhuman abilities, he is a formidable, and deadly, combatant.<br /><br />Even though he has turned his back on Talon, Axle still has links to his criminal past. He maintains contacts with the Armorer, a black market weapons dealer. The mysterious Finch can always be relied on for information that others want to remain secret. And Dr Cutler is always willing to supplement his DARPA pay cheque by selling alien tech.",

(Just today I watched a group implode as the GM and his friend got into a fight - cursing and screaming at each other - all before introductions were even finished). As one might imagine, I&#39;m looking for a more positive experience with the system (keeping all the angst between the characters and the over-the-top villain, as it were).<br /><br />I&#39;m in PST, looking for a weekly group for Friday evening or Sat/Sun early morning (done before 11am) if possible. I&#39;m familiar with Discord and Roll20 setups. Probably aiming to roll a Delinquent (since I&#39;ve got the same unused one leftover from both previous non-starter campaigns).<br /><br />Only real deal-breaker for me is maturity (after today&#39;s experience anyway). I&#39;m happy to play a silly, off-the-cuff, irreverent style game (no issue with smack-talk between characters), but it&#39;s no fun if the players themselves are constantly rude to each other and/or flaking out at the last minute.<br /><br />Anyway sorry to ramble on... Here&#39;s to hoping the right group is out there for me somewhere! ;)"

    "content": "And we&#39;re back. This time doing Trope 3- Smart Guy/Girl.<br /><br />As a reminder:<br /><br />“The physically weak, but intelligent or clever member. Often nerdy and awkwardly played for comic relief. Sometimes unconventionally young (early- to mid-teens). Sometimes a Trickster and a buddy of the Big Guy.”<br /><br />So keeping that in mind lets look over the playbooks that I&#39;ll choose from:<br /><br />The Delinquent- Due to the high base Superior label. Also a trickster.<br /><br />The Outsider- Superior base score. Also could provide Alien high tech and alien high intelligence. Furthermore, different Alien Physiology could make her super young in Earth years, but very mature in Alien years (or vice versa)<br /><br />The Newborn- We already have a non-core Playbook active, so everything is fair game now. The Newborn could range from being an Artificial Intelligence (like The Vision) To a bio engineered creation/clone. Being Newlyborn, it fits the Abnormally Young criteria, as well.<br /><br />So... lets do it.<br /><br />Q: Is this person a woman?<br />A: No, but<br /><br />(...but not a man either.)<br /><br />Q:  Is it Man-made?<br />A: No.<br /><br />(Outsider it is. And it&#39;s Gender-less as well. I&#39;m going to assume that it is like the Asari from Mass Effect. For sake of simplicity, I&#39;ll refer to it as a &#39;she&#39; (cause referring to it as an &#39;it&#39; is a bit disconcerting)<br /><br /> Q: Does she have a strange body?<br />A: No<br /><br />Q: Does she have an Animalistic body?<br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: What Animal is she most related too?<br />A: Return/Friendship<br /><br />(An animal that Returns Friendship. A dog comes to mind (Dogs become loyal to those who care for them. Cats can sometimes show this trait as well (though we all know how evil cats can be. Don&#39;t believe me, look it up on Youtube).  A Google search later and I found five more animals that can be loyal as well. I&#39;m going to go down this list and see what bites...)<br /><br />Q: Does she look like a Rabbit?<br />A: No and...<br /><br />(...and she does not look like a Guinea pig either (the next on the list). So skipping that...)<br /><br />Q: ...a rat?<br />A: No<br /><br />Q: ...a Cockatiel?<br />A: No<br /><br />Q: ...a Bearded Dragon Lizard?<br />A: No, but...<br /><br />(She carry Lizard Traits. Will explore this in a second. We have two left. If she is not a Dog, cat it is!)<br /><br />Q: ...Dog?<br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: What Lizard Trait does she carry over?<br />A: Stop/A burden<br /><br />(Armor. So she has Lizard like Scales.)<br /><br />Q: Does she walk upright?<br />A: Yes<br /><br />(Asked this so I can envision her better. She walks like a human on two legs. For the sake of Comic Book simplicity, she has hands and feet like a human. She&#39;ll have scales with fur growing from between the cracks in between each scale.)<br /><br />Q: Does she have glowing eyes?<br />A: Yes and...<br /><br />Q: ...and Animalistic eyes?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />(Glowing Canine Eyes.)<br /><br />Q: Does she like wearing flashy clothes?<br />A: Yes<br /><br />(This says something about her personality. She could also be hanging around with Nate as well.)<br /><br />Q: Is her heroic costume her native world&#39;s uniform?<br />A: No<br /><br />Q: ...is it her Station&#39;s uniform?<br />A: No<br /><br />Q: ...is it a practical costume?<br />A: Yes, but...<br /><br />(Being that she is smart, and by definition logical, it makes sense that she wears a costume that accentuates her abilities. How ever something is impractical about it, as well. We&#39;ll work on this when we get to see what her powers are. Which is now.<br /><br />Now, the play book says that she can fly and that she is pretty tough. She also has two traits from a given list. Time to go down it.)<br /><br />Q: Does she have density control?<br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: Does she have Stunning beauty or phoremones?<br />A: No<br /><br />Q: Alien Weaponry?<br />A: No<br /><br />Q: Heliokinesis (Solar energy control)<br />A: No<br /><br />Q: Radical Shapeshifting<br />A: No.<br /><br />(By process of elimination, her other power is Telepathy and Mind blasts. Density Control and Telepathy. Perhaps what makes her heroic costume impractical is due to the density control?)<br /><br />Q: Is she used to Earth&#39;s gravity?<br />A: No, and...<br /><br />(...and she needs a device from her costume to keep her from suffering from Earth&#39;s different gravity. Boom. She doesn&#39;t need the whole costume, but it&#39;s very noticiable and it gets in the way.<br /><br />Before we go any further, she needs a name. <br /><br />I&#39;m not going to tell you how I came up with it, but some of you may figure it out, any way.<br /><br />Liats T&#39;sthe<br /><br />And no, I&#39;m not saying how you pronounce it. Lets just say that her teammates call her “Lia” or “Tee” for short. <br /><br />So, Labels<br /><br />Danger -1, Freak +2 (+1 went here, see why below), Savior 0, Superior +2, Mundane 0<br /><br />Now we have an interesting delimma here. It makes sense to put the +1 to Superior. HOWEVER there is one point I failed to bring up in the first two characters: Having +3 in a trait is not always a good thing. In the game, there is such a thing called shifting labels and when a Label get&#39;s shifted past +3, it leads to complications. This is the equivalent of someone being so smart, they look like a jerk. Lancer can get away with it because she&#39;s the lancer. But Lia, not so much. Being that she is a Lizard/Dog hybrid looking thing with glowy Canine eyes, I&#39;ll go the safe route and add +1 to Freak<br /><br />Now for the back story.)<br /><br />Q: Where do you come from?<br />A: Befriend/Attention<br /><br />(She comes from a world that wants to be found. Perhaps it&#39;s in danger of something?)<br /><br />Q: Why is the planet in danger?<br />A: Agree/Pain<br /><br />(Their planet is hurting, but it&#39;s and Agreeable hurt. Maybe they are low on Resources and as a resort, their planet is dieing? Perhaps the feel that hurting their planet is a good thing? A warring planet, perhaps?<br /><br />A google search found out about the Discovery of the Trappist-1 system. The native name of the planet she is from is unpronounceable in human Tongue, so to the team and others, it&#39;s called Trappist.)<br /><br />Q: Why did you come to Earth?<br />A: Spy/Jealousy<br /><br />(Oh dear. So Trappist is jealous on how much natural resources Earth has and sent Lia to spy on it?)<br /><br />Q: Is Lia aware that she is a spy?<br />A: No<br /><br />Q: Is she alone?<br />A: No, but...<br /><br />(Okay... Lia was a part of an envoy. However their true mission to to gather intelligence about Earth. Lia is in the dark about this, she thinks this is a diplomatic mission.)<br /><br />Q: Why do you want to stay here (for now at least)?<br />A: Overthrow/Animals<br /><br />(Who would she consider &#39;Animals&#39;? Not earth, remember, she has no idea about the spy mission. Maybe she is doing this to spite her own people? She&#39;s angry about something?)<br /><br />Q: What is it about her people, that Lia is angry about?<br />A: Take/Elements<br /><br />(SO! Her people takes resources. Like animals. Makes sense, after all, they found it agreeable to harm their own planet. Thus, in the back of her mind, she suspects that her people maybe thinking about doing this to Earth as well!)<br /><br />Q: Why do your people want you to come home?<br />A: Trust/Environment<br /><br />(They like Earth. They REALLY like Earth. But why does it require Lia to come home? After all, couldn&#39;t they just invade and steal resources if she was there?)<br /><br />Q: Why is it &#39;required&#39; for Lia to come home before an invasion?<br />A: Punish/Status Quo<br /><br />(Ah! She is required for punishment based on their laws. She did something wrong, and they can&#39;t invade without putting her on trial. For what?)<br /><br />Q: ...for what?<br />A: Cruelty/Wishes<br /><br />(Cruelty towards their wishes. She is in the way for what they truly want. I could keep digging, but it&#39;s time to come-up with my own conclusions:<br /><br />Lia&#39;s race of Canine/Lizard people (Let&#39;s call them, the Cazarthi) is a race of peoples who go from homeworld to homeworld, soak up the planet&#39;s natural resources to powerup their own warmongering, and then moves on. Earth, among other planets, are on their hit list. However the envoy they sent to Earth, lead by Lia, hasn&#39;t returned, so they can&#39;t make final plans against Earth without that critical data.<br /><br />While Lia is ignorant towards the true threat, she isn&#39;t ignorant with how selfish her people are about natural resources. Seeing how beautiful Earth is, she is taking her sweet time in returning to the Cazarthian fleet, hoping to find compelling evidence or... something to convince her people that they shouldn&#39;t bully Earth.<br /><br />Sounds nice. <br /><br />And now, final question.)<br /><br />Q: Why do you care about the team?<br />A: Open/Extravagance<br /><br />(I guess through them (or by them), she sees how beautiful Earth is, and it&#39;s potential.<br /><br />So finishes part one of Liats T&#39;sthe. Next is the Big Guy/Gal, the powerhouse of the group.)"

    "content": "I&#39;m starting a solo ran game of Masks using Solorpg.com. I&#39;m posting in the forums, but will also post entries here as well for fellow Masks fans to see.<br /><br />------------------------------------<br /><br /> What is this?<br /><br /><br />This is going to be gameplay from the PbtA game: Masks. Masks is a Superhero genre game based on the concept of teen/preteen heroes and heroines dealing with growing up and finding there own way. Think Teen Titans or Young Avengers.<br /><br /><br />How will I run this?<br /><br /><br />The party will be five members (the classic number when it comes to super teams) following a &#39;modified&#39; five man band trope. For those unfamiliar to that trope (copy/pasted from TV tropes):<br /><br />The Leader — (lead singer) The leader of the group. Can be a mastermind, charismatic, levelheaded, headstrong, or some combination of the four. Often also The Hero.<br /><br />The Lancer — (lead guitar) Usually a contrast to The Leader. If the Leader is clean-cut and/or uptight, the Lancer is a grizzled Anti-Hero or Deadpan Snarker; if the Leader is driven and somewhat amoral, the Lancer is more relaxed and level-headed.<br /><br />The Smart Guy — (keyboardist) The physically weak, but intelligent or clever member. Often nerdy and awkwardly played for comic relief. Sometimes unconventionally young (early- to mid-teens). Sometimes a Trickster and a buddy of the Big Guy.<br /><br />The Big Guy — (drummer) The strongman of the team. May be dumb. Or mute.<br /><br />The Chick — (vocal effects, tambourine) A peacekeeping role to balance out the other members&#39; aggression, bringing them to a nice or at least manageable medium. The Chick is often considered the heart of the group. This role is played by a woman or girl. Someone female. Otherwise, it is not a Five-Man Band.<br /><br />Now the modification is obviously the &#39;Chick&#39;. I&#39;m changing that to The Heart. This opens the door for any of the remaining four (if not all) to be female.<br /><br /><br />I will also use the 9q rules, written by John Fiore. These are awesome rules for solo players and if you haven&#39;t tried them, you should. They are compatible to many solo engines and games. <br /><br />Anywho, time to get started! This will be part one of the Leader, posting the playbook info up until the background information. Part two will follow after all five members are some what fleshed out, since that info will be needed for each of them.<br /><br /><br /><del>Character Creation</del><br /><br /><br />Trope 1- The Leader (And will most likely be the focal point of the narrative. If I need a narrow focus on narration)<br /><br /><br />Q: Is it a woman?<br />A: Yes<br /><br /><br />(See? Right off the bat. So I&#39;m justified in my earlier assumption of modifying the fiveman band concept.<br /><br /><br />So now it&#39;s time to check out what playbook, our leader will be. (Playbook is another way of saying &#39;class&#39;. Masks call them playbooks.) Looking over the playbooks, two are specific with being a leader. Those two are the Protege and the Legacy. The Protege is basically a heroine trained by an already established Adult hero/heroine. Think of Robin, a sidekick of Batman. Legacy is someone who shares the same powerset as an established hero and is expected to carry the torch for them. Think Supergirl or Superboy and how the burden is on their shoulders to carry on Superman&#39;s burden if he ever retires.<br /><br /><br />So...)<br /><br /><br />Q: Is she a protege?<br />A: Yes, but...<br /><br /><br />(Off the top of my head she is a protege (and will use the protege playbook), but she doesn&#39;t want to be. Maybe she has a disagreement with her Mentor? We&#39;ll investigate this later, after she is more fleshed out.<br /><br /><br />Now I went to Randomlists.com and generated 12 random names.)<br /><br /><br />Q: Is her name Aiyana?<br />A: No but...<br /><br /><br />(More ambiguity. So her name isn&#39;t Aiyana. But maybe it used to be? A name change.)<br /><br /><br />Q: Is her name Ariel?<br />A: Yes but...<br /><br /><br />(We know, we know... it&#39;s not her real name   Wink . That worked out, didn&#39;t it? Her current name is Ariel. Her real name is Aiyana.)<br /><br /><br />The playbook asks about her Gender, but we already answered that. Now her ethnicity...)<br /><br /><br />Q: Is she Asian or South Asian?<br />A: Yes, and...<br /><br /><br />Q: Is she also African American? <br />A: No<br /><br /><br />Q:...Hispanic/Latino?<br />A: No<br /><br /><br />Q:...Indigenous?<br />A: Yes<br /><br /><br />(Interesting. So she is Indigenous (think Native American/Tribal decent) with some Asian Lineage) <br /><br /><br />Q: Does this have to do with her name change?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br /><br />(Nice. So slowly her background is expanding.)<br /><br /><br />Next is her look.<br /><br /><br />Q: Does she have an Athletic body?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br /><br />(She is athletic, or maybe she is naturally fit? We&#39;ll learn more on this as we press on.)<br /><br /><br />Q: Is she always seen in a school uniform?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br /><br />(This can mean a lot of things. Maybe she lives on a campus with a strict dress code? Perhaps she has a lot of school pride? Maybe she doesn&#39;t have a deep wardrobe? Again, I shall press on, with the anticipation that this will answer itself)<br /><br /><br />Q: Is her costume colorful?<br />A: No<br /><br /><br />Q: Does she wear a costume similar to her Mentor?<br />A: Yes<br /><br /><br />(So when she is a Heroine, Ariel wears the costume similar to her mentor.<br /><br /><br />So we now move on to her abilities. She has an ability that she shares with her Mentor, an ability that she alone possess and an ability her Mentor possess.)<br /><br /><br />Q: Is their shared ability a superhuman physique?<br />A: Yes, but...<br /><br /><br />(From the top of my head, they are both superhumans but perhaps the source of said physique are different, which could be due to Ariel&#39;s mixed heritage?)<br /><br /><br />Q: Is this because of Ariel&#39;s mixed heritage? <br />A: No<br /><br /><br />(...okay, I clicked Likely, but got a no. So something else is going on here. Let&#39;s press on, though.)<br /><br /><br />Q Is Ariel&#39;s own ability weapon and gadgets?<br />A No and<br /><br /><br />(Going to assume that it&#39;s not her mentor&#39;s either. Going to make a note of that.)<br /><br /><br />Q:...Stealth? <br />A: No, but...<br /><br /><br />(...but it is her Mentor&#39;s.)<br /><br /><br />Q:...Detective Skills?<br />A: Yes.<br />(So recap: They are both in possession of a Superhuman Physique. Ariel has good (or I&#39;ll even say Exceptional) Detective skills. Her Mentor is good at Stealth.<br /><br /><br />My thoughts so far is that this could be a Ninja vs. Police/Detective sort of thing. Or even a Tribe vs. Modern sort of thing. Her Mentor is strong with the ways of the tribe, but Ariel is strong with the ways of the city, perhaps? She solves problems through analysis and thought and her Mentor is more hands on (I do not want to say savage or primitive, because not all indigenous tribes are)? Complexity is forming here.<br /><br /><br />This next question (or questionS depending on the answer) is going to be huge, but those of you who haven&#39;t played Masks won&#39;t be able to see why or even know what is going on yet. I&#39;ll explain it later.)<br /><br /><br />Q: Does the Mentor embody Savior?<br />A: No<br /><br /><br />Q:...Danger?<br />A: Yes but...<br /><br /><br />(Okay. In this game, traits are known as Labels. The higher a Label, the more likely that said character has a &#39;label&#39; placed on them. This is how the outside world see them and when someone increases a Label, this is what they think a character should be or how they view them.<br /><br /><br />Danger is a Label placed on someone seen as Threatening, Strong, Bloody Knuckled, and Risky. <br /><br /><br />Other people see a character as a Danger when they think they should steer clear of that character, mostly out of fear of harm.<br /><br /><br />A character views themselves as Danger when the are afraid they will hurt others and/or they feel they can take down dangerous threats.<br /><br /><br />In this case, the Mentor is someone who not only take out threats, but does so brutally and &#39;unseen&#39; (remember Stealth, right?), therefore, the logical conclusion I can come up with is that of an Assassin. So perhaps the tribe is Ninja clan-ish in nature? Ariel is her new name, but in the clan, she is known as Aiyana?<br /><br /><br />Okay, that sounds decent. Now for the label the Mentor deniesSmile<br /><br /><br />Q: Does the Mentor denies Superior?<br />A: No<br /><br /><br />(Another Very Likely question that was shot down. I cutted to the chase and asked this because it made sense. Ariel has Detective Skills and Superior Label delves in the &#39;smartest person in the room&#39; vibe. But the answer is no, so lets forge on)<br /><br /><br />Q: ...denies Savior?<br />A: Yes and...<br /><br /><br />(So Savior is when a character sees themselves as defending, guarding, protecting and stalwart. People se a character as a Savior when they think the character as noble, or selfsacrificing, maybe a bit over bearing and moralizing. They see themselves as Saviors when they feel themselves as a matyr, someone who gladly sacrifices to protect and defend others.<br /><br /><br />...and the mentor denies this.<br /><br /><br />This is sounding more and more like a League of Shadows, here. People who cares less about the safety and well being of others and more about the eradication of evil no matter the cost.<br /><br /><br />Can&#39;t wait to find out who he or she is and we&#39;re close to doing so. First, it time to actually find out the Labels (traits) of Ariel.<br /><br /><br />Now the Labels are (repeating the ones already mentioned for simplicty sake):<br /><br /><br />Danger: seeing yourself as threatening, strong, bloody-knuckled, and risky. Other people see you as a danger when they think they should steer clear of you because you might bring them harm. You see yourself as a danger when you believe you can take down other dangerous threats, and when you think you yourself are a threat to other people. <br /><br /><br />Freak: seeing yourself as strange, unusual, unique, and powerful. Other people see you as a freak when they think you’re odd, unlike them, something unnatural or outside of their understanding. You see yourself as a freak when you accept and own the things you can do that no one else can, and when you think you don’t belong with the people and the world around you.<br /><br /><br />Savior: seeing yourself as defending, guarding, protecting, and stalwart. Other people see you as a savior when they think of you as noble or selfsacrificing, or a bit overbearing and moralizing. You see yourself as a savior when you think of yourself as a martyr, someone who gladly sacrifices to protect and defend others. <br /><br /><br />Superior: seeing yourself as smart, capable, crafty, and quick. Other people see you as superior when they think you’re the smartest person in the room, an arrogant and egotistical jerk. You see yourself as superior when you think you’re cleverer than everyone else, and when you know exactly what to say to make the people around you do what you want. <br /><br /><br />Mundane: seeing yourself as normal, human, empathetic, and understanding. Other people see you as mundane when they think of you as all too normal and uninteresting, but also comprehending and sympathetic. You see yourself as mundane when you think you’re regular, just a person, not special, and focused on normal human things like feelings and emotions. <br /><br /><br />The base stats for a Protege are Danger -1, Freak 0, Savior +1(+1 to make that +2, more on that in a sec), Superior +2, Mundane 0<br /><br /><br />I get to add +1 to one of these and based on the above info (The fact that Ariel disagrees with her Mentor and that her Mentor denies Savior), +1 goes to Savior. So she sees her self as smart and clever, as well as a person who will sacrifice her self to save others.)<br /><br /><br />Next is her backstory. The playbook conveniently has questions set up for me to ask. XD)<br /><br /><br />Q: How did you (Ariel) first meet your mentor?<br />A: Trust/Travel<br /><br />(So Ariel trusted The Mentor once upon a time. And they traveled together. Let&#39;s break away from the background questions for a second to investigate a few key important facts:<br /><br /><br />First, the Mentor. We know the Mentor is likely a Ninja or Assassin. Very hands on, but also values keeping things clean and unseen. Not too keen in self sacrifice or saving others (possibly because the clan itself doesn&#39;t believe in emotional attachments).<br /><br /><br />Q: Is the mentor a woman?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br /><br />(So Woman Ninja. A Kunoichi. And I&#39;m calling the Clan, the White Lotus. Why? <br /><br /><br />Aiyani, Ariel&#39;s clan name, means “Blossoming” or “Eternal Flower”. So the name scheme matches the Clan. What to name the Mentor? <br /><br /><br />One Google search later: Hamsini. “One who is on a lotus”. Very on the nose. Very Comic Booky. I love it. However, the travel thing. Why were they travelling together?)<br /><br /><br />Q: Are they related?<br />A: No, but...<br /><br /><br />(So they share a bond, but are NOT related. Not by blood, anyway)<br /><br /><br />Q: Why were they together?<br />A: Praise/News<br /><br /><br />(Praise and news? Praise is linked to religion. News could mean anything information related. Religious information in comic books is usually a prophecy. A prophecy links them together? Or maybe a religious ritual within the clan linked them together. The travel part could be them isolating themselves for said ritual. The trust could have gathered from same. They relied on each other so heavily, that they couldn&#39;t help but trust each other.<br /><br /><br />With that settled, let&#39;s continue the background questionsSmile<br /><br /><br />Q: When and why did you choose to train with them? <br />A: This was already answered. The White Lotus Ritual.<br /><br /><br />(But to flesh things out: The White Lotus follow the same teaching similar to the Jedi/Sith, that being that there is a master and an apprentice.)<br /><br /><br />Q: Why did they agree to train you? <br />A: Ritual. Moving along.<br /><br /><br />Q: Who else, outside the team (implying that the team already knows, a fact I&#39;ll delve into in part two), knows about your training?<br /><br /><br />A:Inspect/Jealously<br /><br /><br />(Inspect and Jealousy? I thought of an interesting twist here: Ariel&#39;s foster parents. Perhaps detectives themselves? Further more, the &#39;Jealousy&#39; part could be coming from the &#39;Motherly&#39; competition between Ariel&#39;s mom and Hamsini, both competing to raise Ariel in their image.)<br /><br /><br />Q: Why do you care about the team?<br />A: Move/Technology<br /><br /><br />(I like to thank my anthropology college teacher for this one. &#39;Technology&#39; is more than just computers and such. Technology is a way of life. Setting a fire, for example, is a form of technology. The wheel is a form of technology. Copy/pasted:<br /><br /><br />“Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings. The human species&#39; use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools.” <br /><br /><br />The Team must&#39;ve helped her settle into her new home. The team may even be her extended family?<br /><br /><br />Anywho, this concludes the Leader part one. Aiyani, the Eternal Flower (Or even, the Eternal Lotus? I&#39;ll stick with that, as it sounds even more awesome!)<br /><br /><br />The character creation will continue next post with the Lancer part one! <br /><br /><br />Till then, I&#39;ll like some feed back. Any thing you feel I should flesh out or clarrify with Aiyani? ",

The players gave me so much more than I could have asked.<br />They&#39;re a Newborn, a Nova and a Transformed, so they all started with a high Freak and low Mundane.<br />Their hangout is a small island which was a monument to a golden age hero who&#39;s long since been forgotten and no one visits. They created Plutonium Joe as their first villain and hints at the Periodic Table of Evil as a supervillain organisation. <br />Apollo, The Newborn, freaked out at his co-creator, Dr Irons, showing up at a factory going through a meltdown. He froze at the wrong moment and couldn&#39;t fight back or flee.<br />Extraordinarius!, The Nova, teleported out of a nearby top hat and blasted Dr Irons, only for Apollo to get in the way. They had some long words after the mission about that.<br />Stalker, The Transformed, managed to talk down the villainous Edgelord and they all bonded at a Vietnamese restaurant/theatre called Pho Sho.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been enjoying my Blades in the Dark campaign, but it was really good getting to be in a daft-yet-dramatic superhero world."

    "content": "And it&#39;s me again, continuing in the generation of of our intrepid team in my solo game.<br /><br />In this installment, we will create the Big guy/gal. The resident strong person. <br /><br />Also note: to limit word count, I omitted some questions I asked.<br /><br />There are three Playbooks we can possibly use here:<br /><br />The Transformed- Think Hulk or the Thing and you&#39;ll understand.<br />The Bull- Powerset includes Super strength<br />The Legacy- Same as Bull.<br /><br />First thing first:<br /><br />Q: Is this character a woman?<br />A: No<br /><br />(Our first man of the team! Alrighty...)<br /><br />Q: Is he a Transformed? <br />A: Yes<br /><br />(Alright.)<br /><br />Q: Is his eyes strange?<br />A: No<br /><br />Q:  Upsetting eyes?<br />A:  Yes, but...<br /><br />(So his eyes are unsettling... but maybe they aren&#39;t always. The same way the Hulks eyes turn green only when he gets extremely pissed off...<br /><br />Now to check out his transformation...)<br /><br />Q: is his flesh metallic?<br />A: No, but...<br /><br />(But it carries metallic like qualities.)<br /><br />Q: Is his flesh scaled? <br />A: Yes.<br /><br />(So metallic-like scales)<br /><br />Q: Does he have a terrifying costume?<br />A: No and...<br /><br />(...it&#39;s not strange either.)<br /><br />Q: ...unnerving costume?<br />A: No<br /><br />(By process of elimination, no Costume. Knowing the comic code, this must mean that his scales covers him completely<br /><br />For Abilities, only two things makes sense here: Impenetrable Armor (his metallic scales) and Inhuman Might (because he&#39;s the Strong Guy! Duh!) So moving on...<br /><br />Using Randomlists, I came up with his name: Keegan Taylor (I need last names for the first two characters. Will do so when we turn to finish their sheets.<br /><br />Label time. +1 will go to his Freak stat.<br /><br />Danger +1, Freak +3, Savior 0, Superior -1, Mundane 0<br /><br />Rather smooth and straight forward so far. That could change as it is backstory time!).<br /><br />Q: Who were you before? <br />A: Praise/Magic<br /><br />(Digging into this with unlisted questions, I came up with the fact that Keegan is Cape chaser: a normal person who collected information on any hero/heroine he came in contact with. He&#39;s obsessed with them.)<br /><br />Q: When did you change? What caused it? <br />A:  Triumph/Allies<br /><br />(He was at a battle while following a particular favorite of his. because of &#39;Allies&#39; this person is, or soon will be, a close friend.<br /><br />And he does have a friend that is established. Remember the smart guy description?<br /><br />“The physically weak, but intelligent or clever member. Often nerdy and awkwardly played for comic relief. Sometimes unconventionally young (early- to mid-teens). Sometimes a Trickster and a buddy of the Big Guy.”<br /><br />Liat. So the two of them are friends. Maybe in the midst of rescuing him from a danger, he ended up transforming?)<br /><br />Q: Who, outside of the team, is helping you understand your new body? <br />A: Ruin/Disruption <br /><br />(A division, formed by the FBI, who are charged with investigating Metahuman affairs. They have a science division that is working to try and see just how they can reverse Keegan&#39;s transformation.)<br /><br />Q: Why don’t you just try to hide yourself away? <br />A: Remote event/violate<br /><br />(This lead to something interesting. I investigated the &#39;remote event&#39; that he didn&#39;t want to violate)<br /><br />Q: What is he honoring? <br />A: Carelessness/food<br /><br />(After a bit more probing, I came up with Dr. DNA (remember him) stole some equipment from the Cazarthian embassy, leading to Liat giving chase. This chase zoomed over Keegan&#39;s school, where he ditched to follow. In a supermarket freezer, Dr. DNA caused an explosion of of chemicals that, thanks to the intense cold, caused a cacoon like shell to splash and solidify over Keegan. Liat had to allow DNA to escape cause Keegan was in serious danger.)<br /><br />Q: Why do you care about the team? <br />A: Propose Joy<br /><br />(They make him happy. Where other people makes fun of him, he finds solace with the team.<br /><br />Not too eventful. Simple origin, simple character. Kind of a moment of solace after the heavy laced backstories of Ariel, Nate and Liat.<br /><br />One more person to go, the Heart is up next!"

    "content": "So, I&#39;m running a campaign on Sunday nights and I wanted to seek some advice from you guys.<br /><br />I just revealed a potential alien invasion in the works in the recent session. In response the player of our Outsider felt he should explain some things about the &#39;Galactic Union&#39; - which is the major alliance of spacefaring races he had in mind when he made his character. Apparently:<br />- They encompass 99% of the spacefaring states in the galaxy.<br />- Consider all pre-spaceflight sentient species as under their protection.<br />- As such, the Ikkarans (my invading species) would have to wipe out humanity in such a way as to hide their involvement, or risk all out war with the Union.<br />- Since the Union encompasses 99% of the spacefaring peoples of the galaxy, all out war would therefore be disastrous for the Ikkarans.<br /><br />So...basically, he&#39;s saying he comes from this &#39;perfect&#39; society that has no potential for meaningful conflict and any overt invasion plans by my bad guys are just fucked.<br /><br />For context, I&#39;ll explain a bit about the arc I had in mind. I had two arcs linked to this. The main villain, Vanguard, is a former (Doomed) superhero who has been brainwashed by the alien biotech he had become bonded to and turned against his former team, the Amazing Eight. In the resulting battle he was subdued and sent to the Spike, but not before he killed two of his former teammates and another burnt out his powers, leading to the disbandment of the team.<br /><br />After a recent prison break from the Spike, Vanguard is once again at large. He is now pursuing two plans: <br /><br />1) Attempting to contact the Ikkaran homeworld and coordinate plans to create a hyperspace portal for the invasion force to arrive on Earth through.<br /><br />2) What little remains of his old human self seeks revenge on his former teammates, and seeks to eliminate them before the invasion.<br /><br />So...what do I do with this?"

    "content": "Hey guys, I&#39;ve recently been lucky to get into a game of Masks online and I have to say it&#39;s a really fun group, all of the players are good roleplayers and the GM is very good at mixing all of the themes. Everyone also has a good sense of humor and I just wanted to share some highlights from the last session: <br /><br />The first part I&#39;m a little biased towards because my character was a big part of it. So the party was told by a robot to go to a modern art museum or the city&#39;s power grid would blow up. Well turns out the museum is filled with the really terrible kind of modern art (think a canvas with only a perfect circle on it being called art) with the most expensive piece being a sculpture that was only described as the ugliest thing any one ever dared to describe as art. Well then more robots showed up and a fight breaks out (my character used the sculpture as a weapon) and a few explosions later, the museum doesn&#39;t look like its going to stand for much longer. So before my character leaves I ask if there is a single piece of art that looks good, my GM randomly determines that yes there is one good piece (he described it as MC Escher-esque). So my character grabs that art and goes outside and finds an intern (he&#39;s the one who told us about the sculpture) and gives him the painting and I say, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I managed to save all of the art.&quot;<br /><br />The last anecdote all of the party contributed to. Out of character we were talking about potential modern heroes and villains since earlier we met a Question/Oracle like hero named H4ck71v157 (Hacktivist in Leet) and somebody mentioned a villain like Captain Boomerang except instead of boomerangs he uses those fidget spinner things. Than someone immediately named them Sergeant Spinner and the GM thought it was so funny he not only made Sgt. Spinner an actual villain, but the spokesperson for the newly introduced super villain team.<br /><br />Well that&#39;s all for now, but let me know if you have any funny anecdotes from your own Masks games. I&#39;d love to hear them."

The game would either be on Tuesdays or Thursdays, at more or less any reasonable waking time. I&#39;m thinking Thursdays around 12 PM Central Time, but could start as late as 8 PM Central Time. The only playbooks immediately not on offer are the Delinquent and the Doomed. <br /><br />I&#39;m seeking some players who are primarily interested in grand, cartoonish, dramatic interaction with the fiction. High tolerance for the potentially silly is a must, as the &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; section of the book essentially points out. Some darker moments will occasionally arise, but I&#39;m looking to keep this campaign pretty light-hearted.<br /><br />Let me know if you&#39;re interested as well as when you&#39;re available on those days.

My opinion of most of them is largely unchanged (some refinements here and there, but nothing really paradigm-shifting that I can see), but oh my goodness the new version of The Joined is <i>so much better</i> than the playtest version. <br /><br />Having your character&#39;s defining relationship be with another player instead of, well, <i>yourself</i> is a real game-changer, and it&#39;s done pretty darned elegantly on the whole. It&#39;s gone from a playbook that I felt largely missed the point of the game to one that I&#39;d really like to play. Great job all around."

    "content": "Friday we had our second session of a new Masks campaign. It went very well, and felt much better than the first session to me. Admittedly, the first session was character creation and introducing the players to the system, so that&#39;s not unexpected. What made me very happy was how well the system seemed to click in this session, with the players getting more into their characters and the trappings of Masks specifically.<br /><br />So a big part of that was due to how much I spent the first chunk of the session focusing on character stuff, giving them an in-game feel for their character&#39;s lives, as well as the possible complications stemming from it. That part felt really good, and laid the groundwork for the glorious drama and tension that appeared at the end, which was great.<br /><br />That said, I&#39;m having an odd issue with my game. I am super excited about the personal drama and the character-specific stories, but I&#39;m having trouble coming up with suitable superhero stories. It&#39;s weird. I mean, I have a couple of obvious arcs in the background, that are intrinsically bound to the characters, and because of that I&#39;m keeping a slow burn on them, so I don&#39;t just power through the stuff everyone is interested in. <br /><br />So I&#39;m having difficulty coming up with suitable superheroic distractions. I suppose that&#39;s a good thing, because it means we&#39;re all really invested in the characters and their stories, but I feel like it needs to be more comic booky than all that. I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s any advice to be had for this kind of issue, but I figured I&#39;d mention it, because the community has been super helpful while I lurked here, and maybe I&#39;m not the only person with this very specific problem."

    "content": "So the Nova&#39;s deal is that their abilities can go horribly wrong, but it&#39;s incredible powerful and versatile, right? It even says in the Masks section that one of the benefits of being a Nova is that you can do just about anything with your powers, while other playbooks are more limited in what they can do. In exchange, you are far more dangerous to yourself and others.<br /><br />But...some playbooks get access to their abilities and presumably none of the downsides.<br /><br />For example, the Protege can pick elemental control or telekinesis/telepathy as a power either they have or both they and their mentor have. Earlier on, the powers were split into sections and those were &quot;mentor only,&quot; but it got switched to being part of a set of powers the Protoge picks from. The Outsider and the Transformed have an advance that lets them take any two abilities from other playbooks - fine for most, but what happens if the Transformed picks up Biokenesis or the Outsider comes from a fantasy land and has been learning sorcery?<br /><br />If a Nova is in the group, it would feel like stepping on their toes. Here&#39;s a character that can do what you can do, but they&#39;re better and don&#39;t have to worry about causing massive damage on a miss. If there isn&#39;t a Nova it&#39;s a bit better but then you have the issue of those abilities being really open ended and suddenly that character can probably do what the other PCs can, without needing to worry about it exploding in their faces if things go wrong. Should the GM take some of the GM moves for the Nova to be part of the character now? The outsider with Sorcery can use the powers they had before just fine, but channeling Sorcerery means the GM can take &quot;Make their powers flare out of control&quot; from the Nova&#39;s moves, or start using GM moves like &quot;Put Innocents in Danger&quot; in ways you wouldn&#39;t with normal misses? If you don&#39;t, and there nothing in the rules to indicate you should do this, it gives the great power but at no worse cost then the powers the other playbooks deal in.<br /><br />Am I missing something? Are Flares supposed to be super good to make up for this? Because they&#39;re neat, but what I like about the Nova is how it lets you do whatever you want. You can effectivley have any superpower, but you have to pay a real big price for that privilitdge. The Flares are just a bonus. Am I looking at it the wrong way?"

We ended up going with the second option.<br /><br />Several months later we finished the game and everyone agreed it was the best rpg story and most enjoyable game we&#39;ve been a part of. <br /><br />We&#39;re taking a break to play some Dresden Files RPG and Call of Cthulhu, but then we&#39;re coming back for a sequel set a few years later. It&#39;s a great setting and game system, and I&#39;m very happy to be playing it."

I&#39;ve never played a Pbta game proper but I&#39;ve played a lot of blades in the dark so I&#39;m totally comfortable with fiction first and I know the purest answer to some of these questions is just going to be to follow the fiction but I figured I would ask for any insight anyone has. <br /><br />I&#39;m going to play a protégé and I know the rest of the group is going to consist of beacon, delinquent, doomed, and outsider I know some playbooks play off of each other better and some have some overlap so in an effort to be considerate of sharing spotlighting (in the event the gm isn&#39;t proactive about it) are there any themes these books run into that I should worry about stepping on toes accidentally?<br /><br /> Conversely are there any &quot;synergies&quot; I should look for? I know one of my playbook prompt things (sorry forgetting what it&#39;s called) is distrustful mentor who wants you to keep an eye on someone so the immediate thoughts are doomed or outsider for those maybe even delinquent depending on how things feel during proper creation but are there any other things I should keep my eye out to be able to play off of and support? <br /><br />Our campaign is set to run probably about 6 sessions and no actual plays I&#39;ve seen have gone on very long, I know apocalypse world is by nature usually a finite game, is MASKS similar? Does it have the potential to be a long term campaign or does it tend to be that the setting persists and the characters rotate out and are replaced by new teams? <br /><br />Lastly, for influence I have the question of being a personable or a &quot;business&quot; protégé. My initial concept is to go business cause it played into the themes I&#39;m interested in exploring a bit more but it does shaft the other players from having influence over me. Is this a &quot;dick move&quot; or is it fairly easy to get influence over someone? Am I going to be missing out on things by giving fewer (none) players influence over me at the start of my MASKS experience? <br /><br />I think that&#39;s all I have. Any other general insights are appreciated, thanks MASKS G+! <br />﻿ "

I should have expected to read: &quot;When something makes you shift a Label...&quot;<br /><br />So, that&#39;s why in my 1st session I told the players they can shift Labels anytime. But then later after the session, I was like... well then what is the point of the Influence moves and all that. <br /><br />And here I am, asking you all this question."

    "content": "Our Protege player has made no bones about her character&#39;s origin: he&#39;s the crown prince of a criminal organization that was demolished and taken over by criminal rivals in a power play that killed his parents. He was, like, 13 when this happened.<br /><br />His mentor, Lady Azrael (whom I&#39;ve mentioned recently: she has funky demon-sight that lets her see Possible Worlds), is a mash-up of the Punisher and Elektra in a Daredevil costume. She&#39;s a bronze/iron age street-level super with no qualms about using her future-vision to kill street scum.<br /><br />So, the Protege&#39;s player concluded that Azrael recruited her then-13-year-old sidekick because her demon-sight told her that he would become a terrible villain one day in the future without someone there to shape and guide him. So, in a bizarre comic book twist, we&#39;ve got the (classic?) odd-couple pairing of Murder Hero and Kid Trying To Be Kept From Murder. It&#39;s the <i>Leon the Professional</i> archetype if not the actual relationship.<br /><br />So, yeah: the players have all known this about the Protege&#39;s origin. The Protege has not. The Protege does not know that Lady Azrael has seen him go evil <i>in her mind&#39;s eye or whatever.</i><br /><br />Well, in our game yesterday, the Protege met an old companion of Lady Azrael. Said companion dropped the bomb that she split up from Azrael 15 years ago when Azrael started getting weird and talking about the Protege being her sidekick. Companion went ahead and told the Protege that, apparently, in 9 out of 10 timelines, he goes to the Dark Side hardcore. <br /><br />Just drops this bomb on the Protege smack in the middle of the team <i>breaking into Rook Industries to steal important plot things.</i> The team had literally also <i>just</i> gotten into a fight with AEGIS agents who were trying to arrest Azrael. The team has also intimidated civilians to get their way recently... and all of these were the Protege&#39;s plans. This has been a thread throughout the campaign, of playing a joyful, cool, Dick Grayson-style kid raised by a gritty Batman-type, and seeing how that struggle plays out when the pressure gets high High HIGH. <br /><br />The answer is: it has never turned out well, he copes with stress <i>terribly.</i><br /><br />And suddenly everyone at the table, sitting there with mouths wide that this NPC just dropped my twist on the Protege&#39;s origin back in the player&#39;s lap, start talking: &quot;Wait, 15 years, that&#39;s like... your entire life!&quot; &quot;She could have saved your parents, but instead she just recruited you after their murder!!&quot; &quot;So, wait, when she&#39;s shifting your Danger up, is Az just <i>frickin testing you</i> to see if you&#39;ve snapped?!&quot;<br /><br />And one of the players just reaches into the Playbook pile, grabs one of them, and hands it to the Protege player and says: &quot;Here, you&#39;ll be needing this.&quot;<br /><br />Protege player holds up the playbook she was handed, with this huge grin on her face. It&#39;s The Doomed. <br /><br />I love this game. The best parts aren&#39;t even the straight-up super-power stuff; it&#39;s all of the chaos and drama that spools out over multiple sessions spent pushing and prodding where characters are vulnerable, using your Hooks, and watching everyone&#39;s faces light up when stuff that&#39;s gone before gets reincorporated in surprising ways."

The treasure they were hunting was a cultist himself, the Doomed in our game is <b>seriously</b> dark and is intrinsically tied to an inter-dimensional being of great power, who the Doomed has trapped in his sanctuary, and who unfortunately also provides this Doomed with his powers.<br /><br />With cultist eventually in tow they were stopped by an AEGIS detainment team, interested less in their exploits that evening and more on the Nova that was with them, for undisclosed reasons. A brief skirmish ensued in which the commander of the detainment units was left writhing in agony on the floor as the Doomed lost his cool and wanted to find a way out of the situation.<br /><br />Having taken the cultist to his sanctuary, and allowed him to be sacrificed to this inter-dimensional being... with Nova watching on shocked but unsure whether to judge Doomed if this was for the greater good or not (yes, our Masks story has an inherently more grey perspective on life and death in this situation... I am keeping an eye on it to try to make it something that is redeemed rather than spirals out of the sense of heroic duty)... information was found on a number of old relics that were once used by the great threat of the Legacy&#39;s past, who will come again, including the &quot;Marionette stone&quot; that they had retrieved from their fight with the Golden age pirate-like &quot;Captain Slaybeard&quot; in the two-parter before.<br /><br />And so, the team rejoined in the latest session, as team A confronted the sneaky guy on the roof and decided that with their powers seemingly failing them they needed backup and called in team B to come and help.<br /><br />A fight ensued between this balaclava clad assassin like man, who frequently frustrated the team with their powers just fizzling as they attempted to take him down or stop his attacks. Eventually though the Outsider transformed into a silverback gorilla from a height and dropped on their shady foe, ending his struggle against them.<br /><br />They learned that he was scoping out a job, a contract found on the dark web to assassinate the Mayor (who happens to be <b>the</b> Meryl Streep in our little universe). Forcing him to decline the job, and give them information on who he found the contract from, the team handed him over to the authorities... first the super-powered international emergency response force, the SPEARS, who rejected the notion that the guy was under their jurisdiction, and then eventually the local police who were happy to take in suspects that they could question about the bombing.<br /><br />Heading back to base the Outsider managed to get back in touch with her parents on her homeworld, having feared that they may be dead or her planet destroyed. Instead she learned that there had been a major deception, and a break out of their prison.. specifically her as yet unknown of eldest sibling, a source of family shame kept secret to our hero, had escaped. <br /><br />Meanwhile the Legacy was getting frustrated with how much the SPEARS, who she feels could be a great ally, don&#39;t seem to respect her and the Legacy, and gets some advice from her sect leader, Justice, to find a specific contact and gain their trust to get an &quot;in&quot; to the SPEARS.<br /><br />And lastly, &quot;Team B&quot; along with a confused but relieved Outsider head to the pub, the &quot;Golden Compass&quot;, where Ted... an ally of the Doomed runs a small bar/cafe in a quaint part of town. However when they get there they find the place trashed, entering the back room an automatic holo-projection set by Ted plays into the room, showing that AEGIS, specifically the team that were thwarted earlier that evening, have come and forcefully taken Ted and all his equipment.<br /><br />And so now here we are, thinking about the route forward to the next session. Everyone is at the Protege&#39;s base, and they&#39;ll have a decision to make. There is a contract out to assassinate the Mayor, and there is a threat headed to this planet from Outsider&#39;s planet in the form of her newly-learned-of older brother. There is also a desire to find allies in the SPEARS, and also to go and save Ted and put a stop to AEGIS targeting them. Which will get priority? And will their decision have consequences to those objectives that they can&#39;t meet?"

Against his will of course. <br /><br />The Protege going invisible and stealing the weapons. <br />The Reformed taking pictures about Ronin doing this.<br /><br />A group of drunken punks telling the Newborn that Superheros should use their powers to fight &#39;the man&#39; and making the Newborn write it down as a lesson for the future. <br /><br />The revelation that Ronin is a character that was created (in fictional publication history) to draw in the manga/anime fans but who had a really great writer early on that did tons of interesting stuff with Ronin, reconstructing a lot of tropes of anime and making a very memorable run. Nowadays he is still around because the character was so popular at the time but now no author one knows what to do with him. <br /><br />The revelation that the Protege Whisp is mainly doing the hero thing because her mentor forces her to. This actually came out of a nice snowball of moves going Reformed sharing a triumphant victory -&gt; protege sharing a weakness as the answer and the Janus comforting her. <br />"

    "content": "For New Legends, I&#39;ve been using a threat classification guide for AEGIS, though it hasn&#39;t really come up. Figured I&#39;d share.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~<br /><br />All metanomalies are given a two-character alphanumeric signifier, followed by a short descriptor. The first character is a letter which denotes the source of the metanomaly&#39;s power, used to determine on short notice which equipment and techniques are most suited to neutralize the threat. The following list is considered in-progress.<br /><br />A - Arcane. Power is drawn from mystic or otherworldly energies.<br />D - Dimensional. Power is native to another dimension.<br />E - Extraterrestrial. Power is native to another planet in this dimension.<br />M - Mutant. Power stems from a twist in evolution.<br />T - Technology. Power is based in science significantly more advanced than what is commonly available.<br />U: Unknown. Temporary label for new threats that have yet to be categorized.<br />X: Unique. Power stems from a source that does not fit into an existing category, which is not shared by any other metanomaly.<br />Z: Zero. Metanomaly does not have any powers that could be classified as abnormal, but they are in AEGIS databanks for other reasons.<br /><br />The second character is a number which indicates the relative threat level of the metanomaly. The threat level may change over time, as it takes into account both the power and competence of the metanomaly. Past actions or trends of behavior are not taken into account.<br /><br />0: Possesses no noteworthy advantage over unpowered humans.<br />1: Can be considered as dangerous as an armed human. Ordinary law enforcement are considered able and authorized to deal with the threat.<br />2: Beyond street level. Ordinary law enforcement should not approach. Single superheroes and AEGIS teams are considered able to deal with threat.<br />3: Significant threat. Only specialized AEGIS tac-teams and superhero teams should approach.<br />4: Threat to national security. Each known level 4 threat has a multijurisdictional task force headed by AEGIS devoted to monitoring and defending against it. Veteran superhero teams  with special insight are on-call.<br />5: Existential threat. No specific countermeasures exist; in the event of a level 5 threat, every resource AEGIS has access to is brought to bear and we hope that Earth survives.<br /><br />Lastly, a descriptor is appended, specifying the expression of the metanomaly&#39;s power in order to advise which safety precautions should be taken.<br /><br />Examples<br /><b>Sick Burn - M2 Acid Spitter.</b> Modern-age supervillain with a caustic wit who can spit gobs of extremely corrosive acid. Currently incarcerated, awaiting trial.<br /><b>Professor Giant Robot Dinosaur - T3 Roboticist.</b> Silver age supervillain who pilots a heavily armed size-shifting robotic T-Rex. Currently incarcerated, filming new season of show on NPR.<br /><b>Ocelotl - U1 Zoanthrope.</b> Modern hero with the agility and senses of a cat. Current member of New Legends."

    "content": "<b>Playtest Report: The Reformed</b> <br /><br />There is a problem with the way the obligations the Reformed has play out in our game. For one there was no reason so far for the Reformed to get back to her villain contacts for help. Now that is on both the player and the GM of course but a character wanting to get away from these villains wouldn&#39;t really go directly back to these characters for help especially when they come to them with their own problems all the time. <br /><br />In addition the calling in of a favor or crashing into the reformed&#39;s life takes up way too much screentime. In a 2 hour session all playtime can be taken up by that thing, especially when the reformed is eager to work off their debt. While this has lead to one story development that everyone enjoys (I think) other times it feels like a drag that we need to get through before we get back to that other cool stuff. <br />In addition the move triggering every session has proven to be a problem. A session can easily take up very little in game time. Last session one of the Reformed contacts asked them to guard an exchange of contraband vs. cash for them and we didn&#39;t get to that evening happening before the session wrapped because moves snowball. So next session by the wording of the move the same character would call our Reformed again for help even though the thing they were supposed to be doing hasn&#39;t even happened yet. <br /><br /><br />To fix the timing problem we will move that trigger to &quot;when time passes&quot;, just as the Janus does. We will also add a Janus to our game and so we will see how their downtime moves feature differently in the game and how much time it takes. <br /><br /><b>How were your experiences with the Reformed&#39;s contacts in your game and how did you handle it?</b><br /><br />Extra thoughts: <b>What the hell hero</b> has been used 2 times so far I think, both times to just inflict a condition. The character also has the <b>A Mirror Darkly</b> move which I fully forgot about so far because for that character I was focused so much on their contacts. Will try to bring people he hurt more into the spotlight now that I remembered. <br /><br /><span class=\"proflinkWrapper\"><span class=\"proflinkPrefix\">+</span><a class=\"proflink\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/104242213536336786514\" oid=\"104242213536336786514\">Brendan Conway</a></span> and <span class=\"proflinkWrapper\"><span class=\"proflinkPrefix\">+</span><a class=\"proflink\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/110059529477295628562\" oid=\"110059529477295628562\">1of3</a></span> may like this.

Then tell them how you learned/know this.<br /><br />The goal of this move is to allow the players to explore and know more about the stuff that is going on that the Comic Reader would already know. In this way everyone can learn about the basics of what a villain is about (if they are a villain that isn&#39;t acting their very first time) and the lack of a roll makes it easy and fast to use at the table. <br />Also it is not as <i>good</i> as the Read the Files move of the Protege that allows for more insights.

    "content": "This weekend saw me split out my group of 7 in to two groups, due to scheduling conflicts that meant not everyone could be together on one date.<br /><br />It was a good opportunity to see how the game runs on a smaller scale, and to test some things out in terms of what players liked.<br /><br />Session 1 of 2 ran with the group of 4, and they were given two explicit options of potential threats they could deal with, along with two of the characters each being given personal messages/information that they could reveal or not. One of them chose to reveal it because her character was comforted at the beginning of the session.<br /><br />My group is clearly very cautious about getting in to a fight, which is good to know, and means I&#39;ll probably have to force a fight on them if I want them to actually get in to conflict, but it was good to see that they were happy to play in character, and to shun the easy &quot;beat up a bad guy&quot; scenario in favour of keeping an eye out for protecting innocents and helping a fellow team member on their quest.<br /><br />The session 2 of 2 didn&#39;t go so well, which is entirely my fault! I made a treasure hunt of sorts, where the three of them would have to go through the city to try and find information to get them to the location of a cultist ritual. <br /><br />Problem 1: I didn&#39;t make any explicit clues, I used custom moves which enhanced the players as they went along, which would have been great if they got to the final location quicker...but didn&#39;t actually help them find the location!<br /><br />Problem 2: I relied on these moves as a way of giving the players information about their success or not, and the move I had was a roll + mundane. I should have paid more attention to the fact these three characters had the lowest mundane ratings of anyone else on the team. As such, one player managed to rack up an impressive 7 potential in one game through failed dice rolls!<br /><br />Problem 3: I should have accounted for the possibility of terrible dice rolls. It&#39;s one thing to play the averages, but I see now that if there is no planned route out of the situation for the players and they don&#39;t roll successes then they can&#39;t go anywhere. If your game was one where the players could just say &quot;This isn&#39;t working, we need to change mission&quot; this might be fine, but where it&#39;s important that they actually follow the story through... I clearly needed to have more backups planned, and had to ad hoc these hard pushes in the right direction on the night.<br /><br />So... lessons learned, not sure if we&#39;ll be split again next month or back as a 7, but either way there are a few strands to play on for the story going forward, and the players seem to be enjoying themselves."

    "content": "So long ago I posted here to ask for some players for a play-by-post game, and got a pretty immediate response. Felt that it&#39;s been long enough I can throw it out there for other people to peek in after all this time. The link is here <a href=\"http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?508984-San-Fransapporo-%28Masks-A-New-Generation-IC%29\" class=\"ot-anchor\">http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?508984-San-Fransapporo-(Masks-A-New-Generation-IC)</a><br /><br /><br />To give some over-view and just some general ranting. We started out with seven players. Newborn, Janus, Legacy, Protegee, Transformed, Bull and Doomed. The Protegee dropped out pretty quickly as I sort of expected one of the seven would so that brought us to six.<br /><br />The nature of play by post makes it difficult to do things in &quot;sessions&quot; as the medium is slower so I&#39;ve taken to split things into &quot;Issues&quot;. More self contained periods of time where the players have an over-arching goal that comes about from the narrative in an, I hope, organic way. Started, traditionally, with a super villain fight and they wrecked it with some really solid rolls. Spun out from there into a &quot;rescue sick party member&quot; story that culminated in some pretty decently high stakes fights.<br /><br />Also to facilitate some movement in play by post, I have taken to doing End of Issue Moves along with the end of session moves. These are moves tailored to the individual story of the characters to reflect some passage of time or to deal with issues that might be important enough to take care of but not so important that we need to break the narrative flow of the game to worry about. For example, the Doomed got into a large fight with her father. Instead of deal with that fight in the game, I had the Doomed roll to see how the fight went and let them narrate it when we started Issue 2 and then took over the consequences of that roll for where the player started when the game started up again. Basically the moves are intended, and seemed to work well, to clear up the lag time that happens in play by posts.<br /><br />We lost our Janus along the way, but replaced it with an Outsider. We&#39;re now in Issue 2 and I highly recommend any one curious to take a look in. They&#39;re all wonderful writers, I am beyond grateful for getting a team of creative and enthusiastic players who enjoy the spirit of the game as much if not more than myself.",

    "content": "I was watching Steven Universe with my wife, and thinking about how Steven grows from a child with potential into a Legacy while Conni moves into a Beacon, or possibly Protege, role. But while there is a divide between adults and kids as in Masks (Conni&#39;s mom at one point literally denying the existence of monsters and her daughter&#39;s ability to fight them), the overarching theme is family. The teenagers actually seem to be in an altogether different influence bracket than Conni and Steven, and characters like Jamie the Mailman and Mayor Dewey have governmental influence, but no real power over people. I think the show could be modeled in Masks, especially if the focus is moved from physical conflict to social ones, but I find myself wondering what sort of hacks would be called for. "

    "content": "I&#39;m currently running a game of Masks on Sundays, and am considering starting up a second campaign of something different. It would be weekly, on either Tuesday or Thursday, with run time of 3 hours which I&#39;m okay running a little long on, a start time of no sooner than 5pm EST and an end time of no later than 10pm EST. The medium would probably be Roll20 and Hangouts. Cast your votes regardless, but if you&#39;d be interested in playing let me know your time and date preferences.<br /><br />Potential campaigns are as follows:<br /><br /><b>Avatar FAE:</b> I really like both Avatar series, and the setting is ripe for roleplaying. I ran a campaign in it once, but there were a couple of problems. The first was that I used a mishmash of Atomic Robo and Venture City, and it was too crunchy and weird; stripping it down to FAE with Aspect permissions doing most of the work should help that. The other issue is that it was too sandbox-y and I didn&#39;t give there players much to latch onto, plus they didn&#39;t have much hand in world building. To fix <i>that,</i> we&#39;d carve out our space in the setting using A Spark in Fate Core.<br /><br /><b>Fellowship of the Mushroom Kingdom:</b> One of the things I really like about the Paper Mario games is how they take all these characters who would ordinarily be power up pinatas and give them personalities and cultures. The sidekicks are really way more interesting than Mario! So I&#39;d like to run a game where the PCs are nonhuman characters, like Bobombs and Shy Guys and Goombas and whatnot, who have to save the Mushroom Kingdom from a terrible threat while the plumbers aren&#39;t around. The system would be Fellowship by Jacob Randolph.<br /><br /><b>Masks and Mechas:</b> I like Masks, and I like giant robots, so why not combine them? The PCs would be young mech pilots, in a setting where mechs are as much a part of life as supers are in Halcyon City. This one will probably require the most work on everyone&#39;s part to get right, because Masks requires that certain thematic elements be present and we&#39;ll need to make sure the setting has them all."

Does &quot;marking it off&quot; mean unchecking the box for the move/extra, therefore making it available to regain via an advancement?

    "content": "Hi all,<br /><br />While looking over the hooks, I got pretty confused by the wording of the Danger Hook Impulse for &quot;Danger vs Mundane&quot;, which is &quot;To interrupt dangerous situations&quot;. Does this mean that NPCs are barging in and meddling with the PC&#39;s business, afraid they&#39;ll go too far, do the wrong thing, etc.? Or is it that the PC is driven to interrupt and interfere in dangerous situations, painting them in a more dangerous light?<br /><br />Likewise, the other Impulse - to mistrust and provoke - could easily apply to both the NPCs that suspect the PC and label them a Danger (perhaps provoking them to become the Danger), OR could apply to the PC, whose suspicion and provoking of enemies makes them seem dangerous...<br /><br />The rest of the hook (understanding by those close, fear by others) works perfectly for a PC in my game, and I know exactly how to push them towards either Label, so I don&#39;t particularly need this question resolved. I&#39;m just curious, heh!<br /><br />Thanks!"

    "content": "Our character creation session ran too long to get some play time in, so tonight will be our first session. Since I&#39;ve got character backstories already, I&#39;ve started considering some potential arcs and thought I might brainstorm a bit on here. If you&#39;re playing in my campaign on Sundays, please don&#39;t read any further...<br /><br />Red, the Janus: Mutant with energy absorption and impossible mobility. Mother not aware of secret identity, and disapproves of Red&#39;s heroics, feeling that a girl her age should be living a normal kid&#39;s life. <br /><br />I figure Red got the super genes from somewhere, so what if her mum is actually a former superhero (likely Bronze generation) who retired from the life after a mission that broke her team apart. She disapproves of Red because she reminds her of her own youth. In order to bring this out into the open, I think maybe a former enemy of her mum escapes the Spike and seeks out those that crossed them (and their loved ones) for revenge.<br /><br />Cassie, the Nova: A powerful young sorceress, abandoned in the woods by her birth parents (who were scared of her powers) when she was a toddler. Found and raised by an evil witch who wanted to use her powers for her own ends. Accidentally killed the witch when she lost control of her powers. Eventually encountered a homeless guy called Boothby, who seemed to understand about magic and offered her moral support and guidance.<br /><br />I&#39;m thinking Cassie was destined to be the next Magus (sorcerer supreme), but she was lost and adopted by the witch before the Magus could find and train her. He was forced to take on a different apprentice (Everard, from the Deck of Villainy) who took on the mantle too soon after an incident that strips the previous Magus of his power. I&#39;m thinking Boothby is the former Magus, who now recognises Cassie as his rightful successor and hopes to prepare her for that destiny.<br /><br />Harper, the Delinquent: In and out of supervillain juvie since escaping an orphanage which was a front for Professor Van Brutan&#39;s illegal experiments, resulting in his psychic powers.<br /><br />Either Van Brutan or other escaped test subjects (or both) could show up to cause problems.<br /><br />Fomá, the Outsider: Sole survivor of an observational team that crash landed on Earth after a run-in with some Poachers (aliens who raid pre-spaceflight worlds for creatures to sell as exotic pets). He doesn&#39;t want to return home because he resents the overly structured society, and poses as a &#39;transformed human&#39; because pre-spaceflight civilisations are not supposed to know aliens exist.<br /><br />I&#39;m thinking that Fomá is not the only alien living undercover on Earth. A covert agent/bounty hunter recognises him for what he is and maybe enlists his aid in dealing with some alien undesirables seeking to cause trouble on earth.<br /><br />Those are all my initial thoughts on arcs tied to the characters. Was hoping folks could help me flesh them out and maybe tie a few of them together?"

I have a team that includes a few ranged characters, engaging a villain who is a &quot;punch them with his fists&quot; kind of guy.  If a ranged character is attacking someone who can&#39;t reach them, is that still a Directly Engage, since they can&#39;t really trade blows?<br /><br />2. Another character directly engaged a different villain, and chose the &quot;create an opportunity&quot; option.  He used the villain&#39;s cape to temporarily blind her and give an ally an opening to strike.  But it looks like a villain should make their Condition Move before anybody else makes a move.  So am I supposed to have her make a Condition Move first, or wait until this teammate takes advantage of the opportunity and sucker punches her?  And if she gets sucker punched, is that another Directly Engage move?<br /><br />I&#39;d appreciate any advice.  Thanks!"

I&#39;m looking for another player for a weekly game Wednesdays at 8PM PST, so hopefully someone eager and ready to rock because it is soon. We&#39;re coming up on our 4th session and having a blast. If you&#39;re interested let me know. We use discord and roll20, and we have a Legacy, Protoge, Delinquent, and previously an Outsider so anything other than those are available. Hope to hear from you."

    "content": "Our game got weird. What started out as a practice fight between the Protégé (The hilarious Callback!) and the Star (Dreamgirl) went sideways.<br /><br />It started out with Dreamgirl (Rosamie) stealing her teammate&#39;s utility belt. Callback (Naryatti) whined that this was unfair, and when her opponent tried to swing the belt, CB pulled out a secret weapon: An old-fashioned pistol. She put it under Dreamgirl&#39;s chin and fired, popping out a flag that said &quot;flag&quot;.<br /><br />After the laughter subsided, CB caught her teammate/crush in a handstand leg choke.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to them, the training room was formerly a party room, and Gary Lopez (The dream controlling Nightcap) had activated a view screen while making toast. He had observed his teammates fight and, after finding some butter and a plate, decided to join them.<br /><br />Callback, declaring herself the grand champion, officiated Gary vs Rosamie.<br />Knowing that they both had an interest in her, she declared the winner would get a kiss.<br /><br />Then things got weird. Rose activated her super pheremones, making both teammates infatuated with her.<br />Gary responded with a romantic dip, followed by a spin kick.<br />Rosamie grabbed her baton* and swung for the fences, knocking her opponent out for a few moments.<br /><br />Of course, KOing someone with dream powers has consequences. Callback saw an image of herself naked in gym class, while Rose had a vision of The person who really gave her her powers, D list villain CatsPaw.<br /><br />Gary had a journey through the dreamscape, and we did a flash forward as Dream and Naryatti discussed their relationship, and if you could really love someone with pheremone control.<br /><br />Back in the present though, Gary had a new plan.<br />Then things got extremely weird.<br /><br />Sleepy Gary created the Dream Version of himself, right behind Rosamie.<br /><br />Now, masks is a game about teenagers. Although they were reluctant, Gary goaded his teammates to make out with the perfect six pack hunk.<br /><br />They did and it was amazing. However, DG and CB were good at manipulating too.<br /><br />To keep up the tension, the end of the story will be after the footnote.<br /><br />*Of course Rosamie&#39;s weapon is a tasseled button.<br /><br />Here&#39;s the weirdest part.<br />Goaded by the hottest girls he knew, sleepy Gary kissed himself. It was really good.<br /><br />The dream construct vanished within a few minutes, and the three resolved to never speak of this again."

I loved it because it was funny and also made the villain seem more human (despite being a killer robot). It got even better when another hero showed up and the villain was disappointed that he didn&#39;t also have a cool intro."

How you fictionally set up your character can have a huge impact on the general power level in your game. <br /><br />Let&#39;s have a look at the Legacy and the Protege. When you are playing Kid Flash you inherit all of the Flash&#39;s rogues. When you are Superboy you get Luthor with an eye on you. If on the other hand you are the new Question or training with Luke Cage the stakes are much smaller. <br /><br />Another aspect of this are the &quot;When the team first got together&quot; questions. When the notable foe you defeated is The Trapster that is different than let&#39;s say Venom. It sets a certain tone and expectation for the team. <br /><br />Have you found the same to be true in your games? "

The best solution seemed to be to play along, and over the course of the game Dr Bill asked questions that got to the heart of things. <br /><br />The game was powerful, emotional, confusing, confronting... but it led to our delinquent getting to be team leader for the first time, learning about himself and ultimately taking the blame for a villain the Doomed had killed, retiring the character. <br /><br />The villains were of course the TV crew, who for their own inscrutable reasons, wanted our superhero team to work together better and stop destroying the city so much. Dr Bill had power dampening abilities and was also a hostage :) "

    "content": "So a little while back, my table established that in our version of Halcyon City, Rosie the Riveter was a badass superhero during World War 2. It was just a bit of table chatter, so we haven&#39;t really dealt with her legacy in-game directly yet, but I&#39;ve given some thought to what that legacy actually is, and I figured I&#39;d share.<br /><br />So, World War 2 was when a lot of early superheroes were emerging. There were heroes and villains before that--avatars of various deities, alchemists, the occasional time traveler or other aberrant--but WW2 was the Golden Age, the first real generation of supers. And a lot of them joined up with their nations&#39; armed forces, to go and Fight the Good Fight.<br /><br />But at the same time, villains were also emerging, emboldened by the sudden lack of competition. Most of the able-bodied heroes had volunteered or been drafted and been sent overseas, so America was going through a war-time economic boost and there weren&#39;t many heroes around to defend it.<br /><br />Enter Rosie the Riveter: the Woman of Steel, stronger than a rhino and tougher than a tank. She lead from the front, on billboards and TV spots and in the crime-ridden streets of Halcyon, encouraging women with powers everywhere to come out of hiding and fight villainy on the home front. And lots of new female heroes did exactly that.<br /><br />It became a huge movement, and while the boys in capes were overseas fighting the likes of Ubermensch and Hitler, a whole generation of people were growing up with women as the only superheroes they&#39;d ever really seen firsthand. And those people would eventually be known as the Silver Generation.<br /><br />That legacy left a lasting mark on superhero gender dynamics, and gender dynamics in general. So in our version of Halcyon, if you ask the average person on the street to name their favorite superhero, they&#39;re way more likely to name Plasma or Melonica than they are to name Sir Percival or Dr. Impossible.",

Why they are not play books at the core book ( i mean in a form as they are in pdf file Mask-playbooks) its only 20 pages and the whole book is really missing without it (yeah you can print it tho) but still to tak about abilities(special moves and all what is detaily descibet in core.) and have a need to look elsewhere (to know what abilities are what are the whole moves what is you character moment of truth ...) is kind of bad. <br /><br />Maybe its only mine fealing about that and other than that the book is quite of awasome and easy to understand even if english is not our born laguages"

Every radio station and tv station is reporting on the Juggernaut&#39;s attack on a local power plant, stranding 60,000 people without power in the valley below! Feeling <b>Insecure,</b> Cyclops is reluctant to engage the threat. After the Sentinel incident was broadcast on the news, the X-Men were viewed as being <i>dangerous freaks</i> rather than <i>saviors</i>. Jean Grey has <i>influence</i> over Cyclops and she wants to convince him to get involved. She <i>provokes</i> him by reminding him of what his mentor would want. Cyclops does as Jean wants and takes the X-Men to engage the Juggernaut!<br /><br /><i>+1 Team to the pool</i><br /><br />They arrive to see the Juggernaut chuck a military helicopter into the drink. The pilots are goners for sure, but Nightcrawler leaps into action to <i>defend those soldiers!</i> He&#39;s successfully rescues the soldiers and gives a little wave to the tv news cameras. He can&#39;t help it -- he&#39;s a happy-go-lucky <i>delinquent.</i> Then he vanishes in a puff of foul smelling smoke and rejoin his team.<br /><br /><i>+1 Team to the pool</i><br /><br />They square up against Juggernaut at the top of the dam. The unstoppable mutant mocks them, calling out they their only children, they&#39;re no threat, and that they need their &quot;papa&quot; Professor X there to help them. The X-Men reject his <i>influence over them</i> and attack in order to prove they are a threat!<br /><br /><i>The team is entering battle against a dangerous foe as a team: +2 to the Team pool. Cyclops is the recognized leader and he has Influence over every member of the team: +1 Team to the Pool. Everyone has the same purpose in the fight: +1 Team. The X-Men trust one another and they are always prepared. Their total Team pool for this battle is 7!</i><br /><br />Nightcralwer goes first, leaping into the fray to <i>directly engage</i> the Juggernaut! His rapid teleportation is disorienting and <i>surprises</i> old Jug-head! Then Cyclops <i>directly engages</i> with Juggernaut, blasting him with his pure concussive force! Jean gives him a <i>boost</i> with her powers, enabling Cyclops to avoid Jug-head&#39;s blows and <i>take something from him:</i> His footing! Cyclops blasts him, and with a little help from Iceman, they send him over the edge of the dam! The X-Men hide in order to get the drop on the Juggernaut... but now he&#39;s a little <b>insecure</b> because these kids just sent him sprawling.<br /><br />Spyke <i>directly engages</i> and he and the Juggernaut trade blows! Both of them are able to get out of the engagement unscathed! With a little more help from Iceman, Spyke makes the Juggernatu <b>angry!</b> and Shadowcat moves in to <i>unleash her powers</i> and trap the Juggernaut in a concrete wall! <br /><br /><i>Kitty is successful, the GM opts to make a hard move against her. Juggernaut lashes out fully intending to crush her! Shadowcat is </i><b><i>afraid</i></b><i> and immediately _runs away</i>. <br /><br /><i>Meanwhile, the GM informs Scott and Jean&#39;s players that the damage done to the dam is worsening and the water spewing from the cracks threatens to bring the whole thing down, flooding the valley below.</i><br /><br />Jean goes to hold back the floodwaters, <i>unleashing her powers</i>! She wants to stop the flow, but it&#39;s becoming a little bit harder than she thought... and just when she thinks her effect on the water is <i>unstable or temporary</i>, Iceman shows up and freezes the water so that the flow stops completely! <br /><br /><i>Iceman is really great for spending Team from the Pool!</i><br /><br />Nightcrawler comes in again, rapidly teleporting around the Juggernaut to <i>directly engage</i> in his infuriating manner. They trade blows and Nightcrawler is able to <i>create an opportunity for his allies</i> by unbuckling the Juggernaut&#39;s helmet. In the process, however, Juggernaut seizes Kurt in his crushing grip and then hurls him at Jean! They <i>take a powerful blow</i> and are now <b>afraid!</b><br /><br />Juggernaut breaks free from his concrete prison and lashes out at the kids again! &quot;What are you tryin&#39; t&#39;do? Embarrass me to death? C&#39;mon, gimme your best shot!&quot; Again, Cyclops rejects Juggernaut&#39;s words and decides to embrace his recently upped Danger, eschewing the Savior his Mentor embodies. He blasts Juggernaut full force and is able to <i>create an opportunity for his allies</i> by knocking off the helmet!<br /><br /><i>Cyclops takes a powerful blow here and now </i><b><i>Afraid.</i></b><i> When the rest of the team sees what happens to Cyclops, they </i><b><i>take a powerful blow</i></b><i> and mark </i><b><i>Angry.</i></b><i> Nightcrawler, Spyke, and Iceman </i><b><i>directly engage</i></b><i> their rolls aren&#39;t very good. They end up taking on some more Conditons.</i><br /><br />Rogue decides to make her move. She&#39;s going to <i>defend Cyclops</i> from Juggernaut because Scott&#39;s about to get his head popped like a grape! Shadowcat spends Team from the Pool and helps her by surreptitiously positioning Rogue in the perfect spot to pounce. Rogue grabs Juggernaut, trying to absorb his powers and lifeforce, hoping he&#39;ll release Scott. Her plan works, but she exposes herself to danger and now she&#39;s the focus of Juggernaut&#39;s attack! <br /><br /><i>Rogue directly engages with Juggernaut! Because she&#39;s </i><b><i>Thick and Thin Skinned</i></b><i> and she&#39;s </i><b><i>Angry</i></b><i>, she get&#39;s +1 ongoing when she&#39;s handling the Juggernaut! When the Juggernaut attacks, Rogue rolls 10+ and resists his blows with the fantastic strength she stole form him. This frightens him, and the GM marks his last Condition </i><b><i>Afraid</i></b><i> and since Iceman did nothing but help out his fellow teammates in this fight, his player gets the  final narration of how the fight ends...</i><br /><br />&quot;Rogue backhands Juggernaut across the face and then picks him up and hurls him into the air! Then I come up and completely encase him in a hunk of ice where he splashes down into the river below!&quot;",

    "content": "<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23OverMasks/posts\">#OverMasks</a> Last week, I ran the second session of my MasksXOverwatch campaign. I know some of you were curious about how it went, so here&#39;s my report. I&#39;m at college and don&#39;t have the paperwork with me, so I can&#39;t get into the nitty-gritty, but I&#39;ll give you what happened in the fiction. <span class=\"proflinkWrapper\"><span class=\"proflinkPrefix\">+</span><a class=\"proflink\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/112567082028477545375\" oid=\"112567082028477545375\">josh savoie</a></span>, <span class=\"proflinkWrapper\"><span class=\"proflinkPrefix\">+</span><a class=\"proflink\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/109668532332545115799\" oid=\"109668532332545115799\">Evan Janssen</a></span> <span class=\"proflinkWrapper\"><span class=\"proflinkPrefix\">+</span><a class=\"proflink\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/109955560808582310107\" oid=\"109955560808582310107\">Elliot Baker</a></span> and <span class=\"proflinkWrapper\"><span class=\"proflinkPrefix\">+</span><a class=\"proflink\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/109457217832325687423\" oid=\"109457217832325687423\">Alix Janssen</a></span>, feel free to chime in with anything I missed or got wrong.<br /><br />I decided it would be easier to keep the action in one city instead of sending the PCs all over the globe, and I chose New York City for that city because it&#39;s a place where people from anywhere could conceivably cross paths, and yet it hasn&#39;t yet been defined much in Overwatch&#39;s fiction. During the Omnic Crisis, New York accepted a large number of refugees from all over, making it even more multicultural than it already is today. People say that New York is what you get when you try to fit the whole world into one city. Every major faction, good, evil, or somewhere in between, has some presence here. There&#39;s even a closed-down Overwatch base, and the remains of an omnium that was destroyed early in the war.<br /><br />We have four heroes:<br /><br />Celino, AKA El Puno de Libertad (The Fist of Liberty), the Janus and unofficial leader of the team (mostly because he&#39;s the oldest). The son of a wealthy Mexican family with close ties to Lumerico, he moved to NY to get away from his family&#39;s stifling traditions. He shares an apartment with his teenage niece Alejandra and his omnic girlfriend Miranda, and splits his time between them, attending a local college, and fighting as a vigilante.<br /><br />Dova, the Delinquent. She grew up in a town in Azerbaijan, which came under attack when the Siberian omnium reactivated. She joined up with a militia to protect her homeland, since neither the government nor Volskaya Industries came to their defence. But over time the freedom fighters became more like terrorists. They tried to bomb a government building, and Dova lost both her legs in the blast (she got robot legs, don&#39;t worry). After that, she cut her ties to the group and traveled to NY as a refugee.<br /><br />Magnus, the Transformed. He was originally a student of the Ironclad Guild, until a rogue member kidnapped him and replaced most of his body with cybernetics, including an advanced &quot;portable forge&quot; that allows him to extrude molten metal and magnetically shape it into solid objects, similar to the tech Torbjorn uses. He escaped the mad scientist&#39;s lab, and wandered until he met a Shambali monk in NY, who helped him come to terms with his new body, although he still struggles to find acceptance.<br /><br />Scraps, the Outsider. One of the few omnics still living in Australia after the omnium exploded, he survived by patching up his body with pieces of other robots. From this, he learned to be very good at building working machines out of junk and spare parts. After getting fed up with constantly getting beaten up by the human locals, he built a boat and sailed to America, eventually settling in NY.<br /><br />With the &quot;when out team came together&quot; questions, they decided that their team was first formed when they helped a former Overwatch agent thwart one of Talon&#39;s plans. (I forget her name, but she was based off the white-haired woman with swords in this image: <a href=\"http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/november/bconOpeningC043.jpg\" class=\"ot-anchor\">http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/november/bconOpeningC043.jpg</a>) They PCs mistook each other for Talon agents at first, trashed Viskar&#39;s offices in the battle, and still aren&#39;t quite sure what the agent or Talon were doing, but hey, good enough for a first fight.<br />Tracer and Winston heard about them from the agent they helped, and as a reward, Tracer traveled to NY to show them an old Blackwatch base hidden in a subway station, which was abandoned when Overwatch got shut down, but remained undiscovered and untouched, and would make a perfect headquarters for the young heroes.<br /><br />The first session officially began with a security door closing behind the PCs, trapping them inside the base and Tracer outside, and a heavy gun turret dropping from the ceiling. The PCs destroyed the turret, and Tracer called through the door that they would have to find the base&#39;s computer room to shut down its malfunctioning security system. As they ventured farther into the base, they found the barracks and the mess hall, where they met Chum, the omnic cook. After hearing that they were sent by Tracer, who his database listed as &quot;trustworthy,&quot; Chum welcomed the team to Strikepoint New York.<br />Then Scraps got bored with searching the base and decided to use the remains of the turret to build a bomb and blast the door open, which worked, but it also woke up something inside the base, something that made heavy metallic footsteps. After Tracer said some harsh words to Scraps about endangering his teammates, they split up to find whatever was stomping around, with Tracer going one way and the PCs going the other. In a storage area, the PCs found a omnic spider-tank, which Blackwatch had been storing in their base for some unknown purpose. (<a href=\"http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/overwatch/images/7/70/Spidertank.png/revision/latest?cb=20161117024511\" class=\"ot-anchor\">http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/overwatch/images/7/70/Spidertank.png/revision/latest?cb=20161117024511</a>)<br />It was a tough fight, but the PCs won with some clever teamwork. Afterwards, one of the PCs (I think it was Dova) demanded some answers from Tracer and Winston, who was listening through a radio. Winston sheepishly admitted that the turret was a test to see if the kids had what it took to be heroes, but he didn&#39;t know about the spider-tank. Tracer explained that seeing the PCs come together reminded her and Winston of the good old days, and told them &quot;the world could always use more heroes.&quot;<br /><br />In the second session, Tracer had left, and Scraps had managed to get the base back to a working condition, although it&#39;s still far from fully restored. I told them about several problems that were growing in the city: rising tension between a branch clan of the Shimadas and the local chapter of Los Muertos, tabloids reporting a strange-looking omnic stalking the streets at night and attacking people, Strikepoint NY&#39;s sensors picking up unscheduled departures from one of the piers, and death threats against mayor Carrie Himura that claimed to be from Talon.<br />After a bit of discussion about Mayor Himura&#39;s policies, El Puno left the base to deal with a personal problem: His niece Alejandra had been skipping school, and lately she&#39;d been coming home with cuts and bruises. The rest of the team decided to follow him home. Dova actually beat them there, because she already knew El Puno/Celino&#39;s secret identity. I assume they were all in their civilian clothes, not combat gear, because Miranda and Alejandra don&#39;t know Celino is El Puno yet.<br /><br />Scraps and Magnus met Miranda and Alejandra, Celino argued with Alejandra, and Alejandra revealed that she&#39;d been trying to break into the local Lumerico offices because she was convinced they were up to something shady.<br />Dova and Scraps decided to help her, despite Celino&#39;s protests, although since Alejandra&#39;s arm was injured the PCs convinced her to wait until after she had healed. Alejandra dropped a not-so-subtle hint that she has a crush on Dova. Celino left to blow off steam by beating up gangsters, going to a place where the Shimadas and Los Muertos often fought (a Japanese restaurant right across the street from a Mexican restaurant). What started as a food fight escalated to a brawl, but when El Puno made his appearance, both sides stopped to discuss how crazy someone would have to be to put on a mask and pick fights with criminals. Then El Puno mopped the floor with both sides. Serves them right for making fun of him. When Celino got home, Miranda said she&#39;d been worried about him, and they shooed the rest of the team out. That was where the session ended.<br /><br />Overall, I think it went well. I&#39;m looking forward to picking it back up again next time we get the chance."

On the one hand that doom feels mild compared to the others, but emotionally it could be devastating.<br /><br />Also, can there be situations where the Doomed dying is the <i>good</i> outcome? For example, imagine a hero who, for whatever reason, is fated to eventually destroy the world, but who plans to die before that happens, by their own hand if necessary. Is dying their doom, or is destroying the world their doom and dying their escape plan? What about a hero with a goal that will necessarily lead to their demise, like a time traveler who&#39;ll be erased from history if they succeed in their mission to change the past? Is their doom to sacrifice themself, or is it what will happen if they don&#39;t?"

His father, Diego, worked on a research project at Atomo Labs. The project involved dangerous isotopes that would hopefully be used to produce efficient nucleardriven engines. Unknown to Thomas’ father, these isotopes would cause his son to be a mutant, and cause his early death.   <br /><br />Diego died when Thomas was only 12 years old. Thomas could not handle his father’s death, and started to rebel. He took in with several street gangs as way to get out of the house. At the age of 14, Thomas’ mutant powers started to manifest themselves. At first, Thomas would wake up soaking wet. Soon, he noticed that his skin was becoming clear, and that he quickly became dehydrated. The other members of his gang turned against Thomas, and threw him out when they saw his skin changing. In a fit of rage, Thomas sent the gang leader 30 feet in the air with a jet of high-pressure water! Thomas had nowhere to turn, so he returned home.   <br /><br />Thomas’ mother, Maria, took in her son, and has gained back his respect and love. The two have made a pact that they will do anything in their power to make sure these strange mutant powers do not prevent Thomas from making a normal life for himself. Thomas is currently a model student at Halcyon High School, and plans to take the accelerated placement exam for Chemistry and Computer Science. <br />",

They use their powers in a creative way to cage the bad guy. <br /><br />It is bringing what could be epic battles to a quick halt. I know I can create some villains that escape this kind of situation, but I don&#39;t want to make every villain like that. That would feel cheesy.<br /><br />Are we doing this right?

Katya had always been fascinated with the Golden Age heroes and wanted to emulate them. It wasn&#39;t until she stumbled across the armor of the Golden Age hero known as the Grey Gallant that she found the means to fulfill her dream.<br /><br />-When did you first put on your costume?<br />After repairing the armor (Grey Gallant had met a grizzly end) and painting it a bright emerald green, Katya started walking a beat in search of injustice.<br /><br />-Who, outside the team, thinks you shouldn&#39;t be a superhero?<br />Her grandmother would rather she focus on her schoolwork or other, local, means of helping the community (instead of playing at being a knight and causing more harm than good).<br /><br />-Why do you try to be a hero?<br />For Katya, it&#39;s fun first and consequences later. She also is in love with the idea of being a close-to-home hero, someone who spends their time helping the community thrive, instead of always focusing on world ending threats. Much like the Golden Age heroes she emulates, she thinks small picture, not large.<br /><br />-Why do you care about the team?<br />&quot;Together, we are strong.&quot; It also helps that she mother hens the younger heroes. She is all heart.<br /><br />Drives:<br />-Lead the team successfully into battle.<br />-Help a teammate when they need you most.<br />-Save a teammate&#39;s life.<br />-Stop a fight with calm words.<br /><br />Katya as a hero is very much inspired by Overwatch&#39;s Reinhardt (but w/o the power armor and rocket hammer, natch) and my own love of my grandparents and the stories of their lives.<br />As a character, she is very much big hearted. A caring person who wants to help others as much as she can, mixed with a loud, boisterous personality.<br />Plus I liked the idea of a Modern hero who wasn&#39;t inspired by Bronze or Silver -agers.<br /><br />Hope you have fun! I sure am!"

    "content": "Crossposting from Tavern Keeper, because some folks would rather play by googledoc than by forum.<br /><br />Too many cool ideas, too few players, too little time!  In a nutshell, how about a slight variation on Masks?  Still a team of superpowered  youngsters, but with a little bit of a twist.  This owes homage to (among other sources) the Monkey RPG from d101 Games, Anima Prime from Berengad Games, and the Dark Heavens trilogy by Kylie Chan.  A little urban fantasy, a lot of wuxia, and a handy dandy excuse for martial arts shenanigans all wrapped up in one neat little package.<br /><br />Here&#39;s the original thumbnail, which could be easily rolled over to Masks.  Legacy?  You&#39;re from a long line of  heroic gods.  Transformed?  You got turned into a Demon.   Delinquent?  Half the pantheon slips onto the naughty list sooner or later!  And let&#39;s face it.  Having the Benevolent Goddess Herself tell you that you&#39;re a bad little godling is the sort of thing that the Influence rules cover nicely.<br /><br />&quot;Ministry of Thunder&quot;<br /><br />PCs are immortals, or demons, or animal spirits who have screwed up and are working off their misdeeds through community service by helping the Duke of Thunder, Lei Gong, police the mortal world and handling any problems that the mortals can’t.  This means lazy dragons asleep at the switch and causing droughts or floods, rioting demons breaking loose from the Ten Thousand Hells outside of contractually permitted intrusions, naughty Immortals causing trouble to alleviate their boredom...you name it, it&#39;s under your job description!<br /><br />Operatives are allowed their own weapons of choice and are issued an official badge in a plain black leather carrying case and a pair of sunglasses, because it&#39;s always vitally important to look cool when kicking demon hindquarters.<br /><br />PCs should have names based on the various animals of the Chinese Zodiac, possibly with alliterative epithets.  Y&#39;know, like...Modest Mouse or Honest Horse or Awesome Ox.<br /><br />The whole has a retro-cool feel to it, a mashup of art deco and wuxia: tommy guns, Model Ts, big jazz bands, fedoras, swords, fans, temples…Hellboy meets Gangbusters by way of Drunken Master 2 and Final Fantasy.<br /><br />The MoT itself is a ramshackle detective agency on the second floor of a three story building in a crowded neighborhood.  The Boss is a stern older woman who traditionally wears pantsuits and insists on being addressed only as &#39;Duke&#39;.  There is a tiny reception area with a small desk and telephone, three rickety chairs, and a table with several old magazines on it. The main room has a desk and phone for each PC, plus another two.  Duke’s office has a bigger desk, a phone, a tickertape machine that periodically spits out instructions from one of two sources (identified as EBH and WDH), and a most unusual Go board.  There is also a file room, a bathroom, and a kitchenette.  Apartments for the staff can be found on the third floor, but these are rarely used since the Operatives are usually out in the field somewhere.<br /><br />(The Go board on Duke’s desk is a situation map of the world.  Each of the points on the 29 by 29 grid can be ‘expanded’ into an 8 by 8 grid for more precise locations.  How this manifests is that the stone on the point turns blood crimson and a golden trigram appears on it to denote the subsector.  You know it&#39;s really bad when no trigram appears.)<br /><br /><br />Discuss!<br /><br />This won&#39;t be terribly fast, as my Zootopia 77 players are aware, but it could be a lot of fun.",

The move role model, is really cool, as it allows you to copy a PC you admire&#39;s move once per session. However, it doesn&#39;t offer any bonus for following the Nova or Doomed. Was that by intention-as in, they shouldn&#39;t be considered role models? Those two lack moves, unless they take one with advancement from another playbook. <br /><br />2nd. Lessons is a really cool mechanic. However, it&#39;s not clear about his 4 lessons. Can he only have a max of 4 lessons? When he erases a lesson, does he have to keep the prompt, as in &#39;A superhero should&#39;  &#39;I am...&#39; etc? Could he create a lesson without following the prompt after the campaign begins?"

    "content": "Looking at Young Justice, it&#39;s easy to see where the Masks come from.<br /><br />Miss Martian ~ Outsider<br />Robin ~ Protege<br />Super Boy ~ Bull<br />Kid Flash ~ Legacy<br /><br />So, Aqualad? - He does have Mentor of course, but his relationship to Orrin is not the one implied by the Protege playbook. He never struggles with growing into an image of Orrin or not. Their different powers and the fact that Aqualad will never become King of Atlantis notwithstanding, their values and outlook pretty much align already.<br /><br />Other than that, Aqualad does come Somewhere Else, but if he ever had problems adjusting to the Surface World, that was before the series started. Legacy doesn&#39;t work either. There is no dynasty of Aqua-People yet. (Tula might react in that way.)<br /><br />But let&#39;s look at the issue in terms of what actually applies. I think, the most pertinant question to Mask playbooks is their defining relationships. The Doomed relates to their Doom, the Bull to Love &amp; Rival, the Protege to their Mentor, the Transformed to their new body.<br /><br />So what is the difficult relationship that Aqualad struggles with? - His career choice. That&#39;s what the Heroing thing is to him. A job. A worthwile one, sure, but not the only worthwile one in the world. <br /><br />Unlike the others, he wasn&#39;t pushed into this life, like Megan. He didn&#39;t stumble into it, like Wally. It was not his way to salvation, as for Dick. Sure, being a prime student at the Academia, he was offered the position of Aqualad, but he could have said no.<br /><br />The playbook, I have not considered here, is Beacon. Is Aqualad a Beacon? Not quite. Beacons also choose the life, but they do so for novelty and adventure. But that is not why Aqualad is here. <br /><br />And having found that pattern, there are some other characters in other franchises who act similarly: Yang in RWBY, Sakura in Naruto. They all do the hero / hunter / ninja thing, because, where they come from, it is a valid way of life. "

Perpetually offended dickheads call you an &quot;SJW&quot; and make fun of you for being perpetually offended before exchanging unfunny memes.<br />* You draw the ire of an Internet Celebrity who is famous among children of all ages for being angry and pretending to have read books.  Cue the dogpiling of his sycophantic fans.<br />* You take the bait and come off like a total shitwizard.<br /><br />On a 6-, you fail to make a dent in the wave of toxicity.

The move requires rolling with &quot;your mask&#39;s label&quot; so without being forced into spending two advancements to get the Mask and Dangerous Web, how would I determine what label roll with? In a similar vein, I could see a Legacy wanting the Protege&#39;s Heroic Tradition move, but that one references &quot;the Label your mentor embodies.&quot;<br /><br />My current thought is to just pick whichever label seems most important to that playbook but I&#39;m not sure if that really feels right since the Janus and Protege have more conflict with the labels the moves reference.

I feel like it could give the players that &quot;we are second grade heroes&quot; feeling.<br /><br />On the other hand he should be a pretty important character. So we should see him do awesome stuff sometimes.<br /><br />Also he embodies superior and denies savior. I have trouble with the latter: it sounds to me like &quot;don&#39;t be so heroic kid, saving people is not that important&quot;.<br /><br />And of course there are other characters to whom he&#39;s not that important.

As a long-time superhero RPG fan, not to mention of shows like Young Justice and comics like The Uniques, I picked up the PDF right away and am excited to get a chance to check the book out.<br /><br />I sadly missed the opportunity to pitch in on the Kickstarter, so I was curious. Is there any chance to pick up a hardcopy of the game anywhere? Electronic devices are frowned on where I work and I&#39;d love to have something to read during lunch, not to mention I&#39;m one of those old fogies who still likes the feeling of paper between his fingers. :-)"

    "content": "I was watching some Luke Cage earlier today, and I was having some thoughts as to how the Netflix Marvel shows could be modeled in Masks. Cage is pretty clearly a Bull. I think Jessica is a Delinquent, where &quot;psychic weapons&quot; equates to her strength, and Patsy is a Beacon. Daredevil is pretty clearly one of the biggest Januses to ever Janus. <br /><br />But one of the things I love about that show is how important the unpowered people are, how integral they are to the communities that are depicted. Foggy is clearly the better lawyer, as well as the better friend, in his partnership. Karen handles way more than she should, and she does it in a heroic style without ever trying to be a hero. Claire is amazing, any way you look at her. They are not Beacons, because they do not want what the heroes have, but neither are they really NPCs as we normally think of them in games.<br /><br />Thoughts?"

    "content": "Hi all, + Magpie games,<br />Recently some friends and I started playing a Masks campaign ( we are having a blast!) and we have encountered a situation that needs qualification. Namely, how do we handle powers like Regeneration, Healing, and Vitality Absorption. Narratively we understand the intent of these abilities, but mechanically we have had a few snags. <br /><br />Do abilities like those above have a game mechanic/effect, and as such how would that work? Do they remove conditions? and.... if not what is the purpose for having them. By that I mean if we can just describe a broken bone, as a result of &#39;taking a powerful blow&#39; as an example, and we can just narratively justify the recovery of a broken bone, why would we need a power like regen, or healing (like a sanctuary) or vitality absorption? Do powers like Sorcery (cosmic control/powers), or Emotion Control allow for the removal of conditions?<br /><br />Anyway, we figured we would bring the question here to all of you because you must have had something in mind when the game was developed, and those that are playing might have had a similar concern/question.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Jim"

    "content": "So, I just discovered Masks today and have been reading and toying with the system.  Here are some of the character concepts that I have come up with and I am wondering if they fit and are categorized right.<br /><br />Grin (The Beacon) - A brilliant but bored young woman who takes to super hero work to find a real challenge in her life.  She is a master of martial arts and acrobatics along with just being generally pretty good at everything (I also want her to do tech but that isn&#39;t an option expressly available to the Beacon, can she have it anyway?).<br /><br />Raptor (The Janus) - A popular young man looking to do something of meaning with his life.  He has developed flight as a super power including the tertiary powers of enhanced vision, biological avionics, and enhanced physique.  A frightening experience where a villain discovered his secret identity early in his career has made him hyper vigilant in separating his secret identity from his superhero identity to protect the people he loves.  Little does he know that his new girlfriend is the very villain who discovered his secret in the first place.<br /><br />Mark 5 (The Bull) - A robot created to be the ultimate war machine.  Imbued with the ability to learn in order to evolve past the previous failed models, Mark 5 quickly grew past their initial program and developed a personality all their own.  Mark 5 hates being treated as a thing and not a person more than anything else in the world.  They are dedicated to proving their humanity.  Strong, Tough, and self repairing, with an encyclopedic knowledge of combat techniques, and no capacity to feel physical pain Mark 5 is hard to keep down.<br /><br />Unchained (The Nova) - A young apprentice wizard opened the wrong book and ended up getting the Ur-Spell, the root of all sorcery, stuck in his head.  With a mortal mind he can only express tiny fragments of the spells potential at any given point.  This still makes him one of the worlds strongest raw magic users.  How much of Unchained&#39;s personality is the young sorcerer and how much is the spell reworking his mind is up for questioning. "

    "content": "So here&#39;s one of those less than sane plot bunnies that has been nibbling on my cerebral cortex for a while, insisting that I mix my fandoms in ways that ought not be done.  Bear with me for a moment.<br /><br />There&#39;s this little rpg called Monkey, put out by D101 Games.  Think &quot;Journey to the West&quot; and you&#39;ll have the right idea.  It includes a variant campaign idea centered around the Ministry of Thunder, which is basically community service for the gods...cleaning up high level messes and battling demons on the Mortal Plane until you&#39;ve worked off all those demerits.  There&#39;s also a rather funny anime called Saiyuki which is a variant on JttW that takes some amusing liberties with the original--lots of modern touches, including a dragon that turns into a jeep.  Finally, there&#39;s Kylie Chan&#39;s Dark Heavens trilogy which is urban fantasy chock full of Chinese mythos (and also the Road to Wudan trilogy which follows Dark Heavens).<br /><br />So here&#39;s the plot bunny: Masks, Ministry of Thunder style.  Pull a Batman Animated Series by pulling everything cool over about a fifty year period into one vaguely retro setting--big-screen sepia tvs.  Airships.  ENIAC sized supercomputers.  Lots of Roaring 20&#39;s Shanghai thrown in for good measure.  Make our young heroes godlings or worthy mortals (Beacon) or demons switching sides (Delinquent and/or Reformed) or even gods-turned-into-demons (Transformed).   Turn &#39;em loose in San Fransokyo, crank the soundtrack up to eleven, and have them report in to the Duke of Thunder every so often.<br /><br />Crazy enough for you?  (grin)<br /><br /><br /><br />"

After re-reading and thinking about it, I think it is confusing because it is not written as a set of Moves (&quot;When ....&quot;).<br /><br />Here is how I would rewrite this part:<br />&quot;When you take one of the following actions, while having the corresponding condition marked, surround the mark with a small circle&quot; (actually means you mark the condition for clearing)<br />(here, the list of actions and corresponding conditions)<br />Then, another Move:<br />&quot;When the end of the scene is reached, if you have conditions marked for clearing, clear them&quot;<br /><br />Any thought on this ?
